<p>
Over the last several months, I have been using Docker more and more at work.
</p>

<p>
I have been wanting to apply it to something personal, and dockerizing my blog just made sense.
There were a number of weaknesses in the way my current blog works I wanted to address.
</p>

<p>
As I worked through it, I ran into enough "gotchas" that I thought a more thorough writeup was worth doing. <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
Hopefully I can help someone else who is new-ish to docker (or, more honestly, hopefully I stop making some of these
mistakes myself).

<p>
<b>tl;dr</b> basically I have two services that need to run, <code>jekyll</code> and an <code>org-mode</code> compiler service.
</p>

<p>
Over time, I have grown less-and-less satisfied with Jekyll (and Markdown, especially).
I really wanted author posts in <code>org-mode</code>. Of course, there are several solutions that exist for this,
but the only one with the featues I wanted is the official implementation. So, I wrote a little <code>org-mode</code> compilation service.
A while ago I wrote about <a href="http://joelmccracken.github.io/entries/org-mode-jekyll-plugin/">the initial implementation</a>. That ended up being unacceptably slow, so I hacked together a little TCP service
that vastly improved performance. <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> End Goal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I wanted to have two separate containers, one running Jekyll, and the other running the Emacs service.
Additionally, I want the potential to add more services in the future.
</p>

<p>
The theoretical of attaining this is short to describe:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Find or build an image for each services' container.
</li>
<li>Experiment to find the correct container configuration for the services to run together.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Modify the application code in each service to facilitate the dockerization, if necessary.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Combine these configurations into a <code>docker-compose</code> file.
</li>
<li>Test, iterate, and use.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
As I alluded to earlier, this is harder than it sounds.

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> When building docker images, look for existing <code>Dockerfile</code> examples</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Sometimes, there might be a Docker image that does exactly what you need it to, and you won't have to build a custom image.
For me, this has rarely been the case.
</p>

<p>
In the case of my Jekyll image, I couldn't find an existing image that did what I wanted. The mistake I made at this point was to
try to figure it out without looking for any resources. I quickly ran into issues.
</p>

<p>
In fact, I have consistently found it surprisingly hard to dockerize software.
I always run into some unexpected environment issues &#x2013;
probably largely because of "minimal" base images<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>,
but there may be other issues in play.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly (to me, at least), I found an emacs image that was perfect for my use. I used it as a base images to build the org compilation service.

<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Inter-application communication is trickier</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
When something runs on my machine, my default "go-to" solution is to use <code>localhost</code>. This has tripped me up a few times, since services in separate containers
are not on the same <code>localhost</code>. Components will often need to be reconfigured (for example,
<a href="https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/commit/0f270d6a112529b1507c7df079af6cf5acb9f6fc#diff-aff17c3de884a9fa9b3ddfeddbdaf82fR60">a service may need to listen</a>
on <code>0.0.0.0</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>, and
<a href="https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/commit/83d93eb78f52bba8a6d69d8e0a540b77fc3ab883#diff-63d56d6c9416c6f37fb26a8e756a7008R16">a client may need to connect</a>
to a the containers name, instead of <code>localhost</code>).
</p>

<p>
This is good to keep in mind, because when you run into it, if this is the problem you will have a much easier time than going through all the steps to debug
your network connectivity.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Use an entrypoint script</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
When building docker images, it is MUCH easier to have
<a href="https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/blob/writing/_emacs-org-compiler/start-server.sh">an entrypoint script</a>
than to attempt a complicated invocation within the <code>Dockerfile</code>'s <code>CMD</code> or <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> settings.
I have made this mistake several times. The syntax that <code>CMD</code> and <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> accept is weird.
It can be really non-obvious when these are not correct. Just use a run (or entrypoint) script to run your
container's application code.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Docker tools are weird</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Docker is an awesome tool, but I find many of its design decisions surprisingly limiting. I don't know how else to say it besides that.
Why can't I start an <b>existing, stopped</b> container with a different command than what it was created with? Why is it so hard to encode compilcated
scenarios in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files?
</p>

<p>
In the end, I ended up with two separate <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, and the only differences between each of them is that one uses a different
<code>jekyll</code> command from the other. I also have three separate shell scripts in the <code>bin</code> directory which provide a nicer interface for:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Serving the site with Jekyll in drafts mode.
</li>
<li>Serving the production version of the site.
</li>
<li>Building and deploying the site.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Could I possibly have simplified this into fewer pieces? I am sure I will in the future. But at the moment I've hit enough problems figuring out how to
do that that I just want to get some work done.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I don't want to come across as overly negative about Docker. It is an incredible tool that has rightly received a lot of hype. Even though parts of
it are awkward to work with, containerized applications are just so nice that I believe the pain is well worth it.

Here I am trying to break that pattern.

At one point I wanted to write about that experience, which was actually kinda interesting (This was the first "raw tcp"
service I had ever written that was useful (as opposed to being a learning experience). There are a few interesting pieces:
</p>

<p class="footpara">
The <a href="https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/blob/444cac503c09d884ed148d961f449380b8ab72c5/_plugins/org-converter.rb">Jekyll plugin written in Ruby</a> which starts and stops the <code>org-mode</code> compilation service, and
<a href="https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/blob/0f270d6a112529b1507c7df079af6cf5acb9f6fc/_emacs-org-compiler/org-convert.el">the org-mode service</a> that receives the raw <code>org-mode</code> text over a socket and responds with the compiled html version.
</p>

<p class="footpara">
Part of that support was code for
<a href="https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/blob/0f270d6a112529b1507c7df079af6cf5acb9f6fc/_plugins/org-converter.rb#L19">automatically starting</a>
the required emacs process, so the service would be ready when Jekyll needed it.
This was tricky though and had bugs. As I learned Docker, it quickly became clear that it would work better as a separate service
specified in a <code>docker-compose</code> file.
</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.3" name="fn.3" class="footnum" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
with a small base image, you end up needing to specify <b>everything</b> for your app. In my experience, an app that runs easily on regular ubuntu 16.04
does not mean it works on the ubuntu:16.04 image just as easily, for example.
</p>

<p class="footpara">
Eventually I looked at the repo I had evaluated ealier (<a href="https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker">https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker</a>),
which I was able to use as an example.
What I ended up with (<a href="https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/blob/writing/_jekyll-image/Dockerfile">https://github.com/joelmccracken/joelmccracken.github.com/blob/writing/_jekyll-image/Dockerfile</a>) was way more

Some of it is probably unnecessary and cargo-culted, but I tried pulling some of it out and ran into issues (e.g. not running as <code>jekyll</code> user).
