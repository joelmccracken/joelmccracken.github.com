                    <article class="post-content">
                        <p>I’ve been using and thinking about open source for a long time now.
At some point in the past, it was a serious concern whether or not
someone could produce open source and still make a viable
living. Thankfully, that open question is almost settled.</p>

<p>I still wonder about the ethics central to open source. Everyone seems
to have a different take on the ethics, and I honestly can’t figure
out an ethics story that is very compelling to me, personally.</p>

<p>Nowadays, when we talk about ethics of open source, I think the
discussion focuses on organizational structures and license
considerations. How do we structure our projects? What systems
(such as Github) do we use to host our code? How do these choices
impact our users? Do we license with the GPL or a BSD-style license?</p>

<p>For me, closed-source software is always raises ethical
considerations. And, I personally have no good answer to these ethical
considerations, except “open source good, closed source bad”.
Thinking about this used to make me feel confused, and typically would
prompt analysis paralysis about whatever it was I was trying to
decide. The only thing to do is just plow ahead and get things done,
which normally meant just using whatever closed system I needed.</p>

<p>Realistically, being free of closed software is an impossible goal.
Even if you have managed to use a machine that is perfectly free of closed
software, you still need to integrate with closed systems. Our need to
communicate with the outside world still exists, and the internet is
not free. The AGPL provides ample evidence that many people have
thought about this; and yet, they still use the internet.</p>

<p>Recently, my feelings about all this have been coalescing into a
better understaing of how to evaluate closed source software in my life.
Closed source is a fact of life. Choosing to use
a given piece of closed source software is a tradeoff. There are costs
of avoiding closed source, just as there are
benefits to using open source.</p>

<p>So, what factors play into deciding to really use a closed system?
Here are some questions to consider:</p>

<p>How likely is it that closed software will stop doing what you
need it to? At some time in the past there was a question whether or
not Twitter will close its API and kill its client ecosystem. That day
has come and gone, and now the ecosystem is dead.</p>

<p>Does the closed system even do what you want it to? Might it actually
contain a bug/decently large problem that you have no real way to notice?
For example, I can make OS X system backups all I want, but since I have no
effective ways of testing these backups, I can’t be sure that
they are actually doing anything at all.</p>

<p>Can you export your data? In the event that the system changes, do you
have some way to keep the works you have created? With twitter, we can
at least export our tweets. However, a great deal of the value of
twitter is in the social connections we have established through it,
and these can’t be exported.</p>

<p>How likely is it that the closed source system is somehow causing
something you disagree with? I’m pretty sure that Google is in the
advertising business; would it be a stretch to imagine that it is
trying to mine our lives for data in order to better serve us ads?</p>

<p>A very practical example of this is using Flash. Today, we can avoid
Flash. Using Flash exposes us to Flash cookies, which is a huge
privacy hole that we know is currenly exploited. Of course, using
Flash can be very convenient. Is it worth the convenience?</p>

<p>These types of questions that focus on value and risk leave me feeling
good. Instead of worrying about the broader ethics of what closed
source means, I can focus on specific instances and think about
them as risk. I still know that closed source is a risk factor, but
its one I often take as a personal decision, often with good reason.</p>
