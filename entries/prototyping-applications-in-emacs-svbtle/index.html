                    <article class="post-content">
                        <p>I’m always on the lookout for new ways to improve myself.
Emacs is one of the ways that I do this. 
Because all of Emacs’ features are extremely accessible, it is easy to
quickly build what you need to get things done.</p>

<p>I have written a few of these “mini-applications”, but one is fresh in
my mind: svbtle. 
When svbtle was announced/released, I had mixed feelings
about it. However, one of the things that I <em>do</em> really like is the
application’s split between published posts and ideas.</p>

<p>In case you don’t remember, everything in svbtle is either a published
post, or an idea. I think this split works, because pre-publishing,
writing is so… ephemeral. However, once something is out there, it
takes on a completely different character.</p>

<p>I feel like <em>draft</em> has a negative connotation. An unpublished draft
is basically an undone to-do. Even the word draft implies work that
still needs to be done.</p>

<p>However, labeling drafts as <em>ideas</em> changes them. Ideas are
positive. The more ideas you have, the better. And, an unpublished
idea is just, well, still an idea. I think this cognitive
shift encourages the writing process.</p>

<p>So, I made a mental note, and began thinking about how I could implement this
in my writing process. Over the last few weeks, I spent 20 or so minutes here
and there hacking some code together that lets me think this way. So,
for a total of <em>at most</em> two hours, I got most of the 
benefit that I perceive from svbtle. And, that makes me very happy.</p>

<p>Now, time for the code. It isn’t pretty or well-factored, but it
does what I need. I want to show it like this because it
works, and is good enough. There’s nothing magic here; its straight-up
maneuvering of files, Emacs buffers, and window layouts. It also sits
on top of Jekyll, because that I what I started with.</p>
