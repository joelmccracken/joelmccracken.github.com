I'm working on an Elm emulator for the the game
<i><a href="http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine">Human Resource Machine</a></i>.
The goal of the game is to use a sort of "assembly-like" language to control a character
and have them perform requested tasks.
The player puts commands together by dragging commands around as blocks.
Its a basically a "visual" assembly language.
The levels in the game have been fun and challenging enough to keep me interested.
</p>

<p>
Each level is presented as a conveyor belt inbox, a conveyor belt outbox, and some place to work with.
The player is asked to transform the input in some way, using the commands that are available for this level.
</p>

<p>
I thought it would be a fun exercise to write an emulator for the the game in Elm.
I want to fix a number of usability issues I see in the game.
Also, I've been wanting to learn to write games.
While this isn't a game, it is closely tied to a game,
and I think it addresses the same desire.
</p>

<p>
I'm still learning Elm, so this code probably has many flaws. Still, I
believe it is useful to see things through my eyes, as they are, now.
If you notice something that could be better, please, let me know
in the comments.

<p>
What would make a good online emulator, something that people might find worth using?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The HRM editor is very basic. While good, I find it frustrating because of the inability
to write comments, among other things.
Later on in the game, you gain the ability to create little comment-y slips of paper, but
this requires you
to actually "draw" the words with your mouse/trackpad. It is really, really bad.
I'd much rather work with "normal" comments, and there is no practical reason
</li>
<li>Instead of working with text, in HRM you drag around boxes with words in them. This is more akin
to programming with the MIT scratch project than traditional programming. This
is OK, and I think it is a good idea for beginners, but I personally want to write text.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> MVP</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I first wanted to write a "proof-of-concept", from which I can add more features, over time.
</p>

<p>
The smallest design that I could come up with for this proof-of-concept is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Only emulate the first level, which has the most basic set of instructions.
</li>
<li>Each second, apply the next instruction to the machine status.
</li>
<li>Show the machine status after each instruction is calculated.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first level consists of a simple task: For each item on an inbox conveyor belt, place it on the outbox conveyor belt.
We are given two possible instructions: 'inbox', and 'outbox'. The 'inbox' command instructs the character to pick
something up off the inbox
and hold it in their hands. The 'outbox' command says to place whatever is being held on the outbox.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The Program</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Lets go through the solution, piece by piece, starting with the most straightforward pieces first.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Model</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
The easiest way to represent instructions is as a Union type:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">type Instruction = Inbox
		 | Outbox
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Hard-coding the solution program as an array of instructions makes this proof of concept easier:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">program : Array Instruction
program =
  Array.fromList
	 [ Inbox
	 , Outbox
	 , Inbox
	 , Outbox
	 , Inbox
	 , Outbox
	 ]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It seems like every Elm program has a "Model" type, and this is no exception:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">import Array exposing (Array)

type alias Model =
    { program : Array Instruction
    , status  : MachineStatus
    }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So, model is a combination between a program and an emulated "machine".
</p>

<p>
There is some forward thinking going on in this design. The model <i>could</i> be
slightly simpler for this MVP, but part of the goal of this iteration is to
explore what the solution may look like in the future.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>program</code> is listed as part of the model, although it needn't be in this case,
since it is hard-coded and won't change. However, we want this to be different
very soon, so it makes sense to just put this on the model, for now.
</li>

<li><code>status</code> is a separate type because in the future I want to maintain a list of all statuss,
for debuggability. It becomes just a little easier to refactor to a list if it is
separate, and allows for a little bit of exploration of what a <code>MachineStatus</code> type
should contain.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">type alias MachineStatus =
    { status : Status
    , held   : Maybe Value
    , input  : List Value
    , output : List Value
    , pc     : Int
    }

type Status = Running | Complete | Error String
</pre>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>status</code> signifies execution completion. I strongly suspect that this will go somewhere else, as
it feels strange to have it in here. But, this is OK for now.
</li>
<li><code>held</code> represents the current value that is being held. In HRM, what you
hold is akin to a CPU register; your character do calculations with and moves values to and
from their hands &#x2013; which, really, is just like real life. This is a <code>Maybe</code> because it is possible
for the hands to be empty.
</li>
<li><code>input</code> represents the input conveyor. Values are taken from it and manipulated.
</li>
<li><code>output</code> represents the output conveyor, onto which values are placed.
</li>
<li><code>pc</code> represents the "program counter". This is the index of the next instruction to be executed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You may notice that the above references a <code>Value</code>. This is the "values" that may be worked with
in the game:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">type Value = Int
</pre>
</div>
<p>
For now, we are only working with integers.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Program Scaffolding &amp; View</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
I'm not sure where to mention this, but I want to include here the bits and pieces that
make the program actually run. I think its helpful to get them out of the way.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">import Html.App as Html

main : Program Never
main =
  Html.program { init = init, view = view, update = update, subscriptions = subscriptions }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The program is an <code>Html.program</code>, with the basic wiring.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">import Time exposing (Time, second)

subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
  Time.every second Tick
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Tick each second. The only input the program receives for now are
ticks.
</p>

<p>
The view can also be made fairly simple:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">import Html exposing (Html, div, text)


-- VIEW

renderState : MachineState -&gt; Html a
renderState state =
    div [] [text (toString state)]


view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ div [] [text (toString model.program)]
    , renderState model.state
    ]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Instead of worrying about anything very complicated, we just use Elm's <code>toString</code> method
to create a user-readable version of the data structure.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> The Update</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The "meat" of the application is the update functionality. This is the code that actually
emulates the machine.
</p>

<p>
With our types defined, the code is not necessarily overly-complicated:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">-- UPDATE

type Msg
  = Tick Time


update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update action model =
  case action of
    Tick newTime -&gt;
	let
	    isComplete = model.state.status
	in
	    case isComplete of
		Running -&gt; (stepModel model, Cmd.none)
		_       -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The function <code>update</code> is the main loop. On each tick of the clock,
apply an instrution and compute the next version of the model
if the machine is still running.
</p>

<p>
I didn't point this out earlier, but there are two other status types:
<code>Complete</code> and <code>Error String</code>. Complete indicates that the program completed
successfully, and is no longer running. <code>Error String</code> provides a way to report
an error if the program tries to do something invalid, such as:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Finish without the correct values being on the output conveyor.
</li>
<li>Tries to pick up something from the input conveyor when the conveyor is empty.
</li>
<li>Tries to place something on the output conveyor when the character is not
holding anything.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although, there are others. Next up, <code>stepModel</code>, which is where things begin
to get interesting.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">stepModel : Model -&gt; Model
stepModel model =
  let curr = currentInstruction model.program model.state.pc
  in case curr of
    Just instruction  -&gt;
      processInstruction instruction model
    Nothing        -&gt;
      updateState model (\s-&gt; { s | status = Error "The machine attempted to access an invalid instruction."})
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Before calculating the next state,
Calculating the next value of the model involves:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Finding the current instruction to execute.
</li>
<li>Performing a specific action based upon the current instruction.
</li>
<li>Performing some bookkeeping: Move to the next counter, complete
the state if the program has finished, etc.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Lets look at each of these functions, one at a time.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">currentInstruction : Array Instruction -&gt; Int -&gt; Instruction
currentInstruction instructions pc =
  case (Array.get pc instructions) of
    Just a  -&gt; a
    Nothing -&gt; Debug.crash "you're trying to access an instruction that doesn't exist"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is one of those situations where a type system makes things interesting. I wouldn't have
thought about <code>Array.get</code> possibly failing without it returning a <code>Maybe</code>, which I then have
to deal with.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-elm">updateState : Model -&gt; (MachineState -&gt; MachineState) -&gt; Model
updateState model updater =
    let newState = updater model.state
    in { model | state = newState }


stepPC : Model -&gt; Model
stepPC model =
    updateState model (\s-&gt; {s | pc = s.pc + 1 })


completeIfFinished : Model -&gt; Model
completeIfFinished model =
  let programLength = Array.length model.program
      pc = model.state.pc
  in if pc &lt; programLength then
	 model
     else
	 updateState model complete


shiftInboxToHands : Model -&gt; Model
shiftInboxToHands model =
  let first = List.head model.state.input
      rest  = case List.tail model.state.input of
		Just r  -&gt; r
		Nothing -&gt; []
  in case first of
       Just val -&gt;
	   updateState model (\s-&gt; { s | held = Just val, input = rest})
       Nothing -&gt; updateState model (\s-&gt; {s | status = Error "tried to pick up an item from the inbox, but inbox was empty" })


-- state manipulators

complete : MachineState -&gt; MachineState
complete state = { state | status = Complete }


shiftHandsToOutbox : Model -&gt; Model
shiftHandsToOutbox model =
  let currentState = model.state
  in case model.state.held of
    Nothing  -&gt; updateState model complete
    Just val -&gt; { model | state =
		     { currentState
			 | held = Nothing,
			   output  = (val :: currentState.output)
		     }}
