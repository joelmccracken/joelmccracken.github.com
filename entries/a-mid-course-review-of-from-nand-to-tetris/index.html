                        <p>
I've been taking the course "From NAND to Tetris" on Coursera. So far,
the course has been very interesting, and I recommend it. It provides
a good taste of how computers work from a low level, starting at the
most basic logic gates and building up from there. I'm over half way
through, and have some observations.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This course has been a blast! Slowly building up a computer from
first principles has been very rewarding. Its an amazing
feeling to struggle with designing a chip and then to turn around
and use it in another, more advanced chip!
</li>

<li>The course hasn't been that hard. Now, I had some classes that
dealt with this kind of thing at Pitt. I remember working with
most of these concepts in the past, so this is not totally foreign
to me. However, I also think that the professors did an excellent
job simplify things to their essential concepts.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I'm really glad I have invested my time into this course. If you want
to learn more about how computers work on a low level (or even if you
would like a refresher into the topic), I highly recommend it.
