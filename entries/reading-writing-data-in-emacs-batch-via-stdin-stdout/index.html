    <h1>Reading from stdin and writing to stdout with Emacs batch</h1>
    <p class="meta">May 14, 2014</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>So, this is something that has irritated me from time to time about
emacs. I have long thought that it was not possible to read data from stdin
from emacs when in batch mode (I had discovered that <code>(message &quot;foo&quot;)</code>
would write foo to stdout, so that wasn&#39;t an issue). I have tried to
search google for it in the past, but I never found what I was looking
for.</p>

<p>I have again been dealing with this problem, and finally found the
solution, which is documented at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Batch-Mode.html#Batch-Mode">(info &quot;(elisp) Batch Mode&quot;)</a>.</p>

<p>The relvant selection is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Any Lisp program output that would normally go to the echo area,
either using `message&#39;, or using `prin1&#39;, etc., with `t&#39; as the stream,
goes instead to Emacs&#39;s standard error descriptor when in batch mode.
Similarly, input that would normally come from the minibuffer is read
from the standard input descriptor.  Thus, Emacs behaves much like a
noninteractive application program.  (The echo area output that Emacs
itself normally generates, such as command echoing, is suppressed
entirely.)
</code></pre></div>
<p>So, we can use <code>read-from-minibuffer</code> to get data from stdin, and
<code>princ</code> to write data.</p>

<h2>A Real-World Example</h2>

<p>My goal was to write a plugin for Jekyll that will convert org mode
files into blog posts (which is working, but I still need to tweak
things, so that will be saved for a later post).</p>

<p>Basically, Jekyll reads the files that represents your posts, removes
yaml metadata from the head of the document, and hands the content of
the file to the converter plugin. Thus, I have the text contents of an
org file, and need to convert that to an html version. In an ideal
world, I would be able to pipe this text into emacs and have it output
the html I want.</p>

<p>The portion of elisp that implements this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">(defun compile-org-file ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((org-document-content &quot;&quot;)
        this-read)
    (while (setq this-read (ignore-errors
                             (read-from-minibuffer &quot;&quot;)))
      (setq org-document-content (concat org-document-content &quot;\n&quot; this-read)))

    (with-temp-buffer
      (org-mode)
      (insert org-document-content)
      (org-html-export-as-html)
      (princ (buffer-string)))))
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are a number of things to point out, here.</p>

<p><code>read-from-minibuffer</code> was tricky, and needed some special consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>No prompt should be displayed to the user, since data is coming in
unprompted. Thus, an empty string argument.</li>
<li>This function reads in a single line at a time. As data is
read in, it must be appended to what has already been read.</li>
<li>When EOF is read, an error is thrown, which is useless to
us. Instead of worrying about the error, we can wrap the function
call in an <code>ignore-errors</code> macro, which will return <code>nil</code> when an
EOF occurs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the entire data is read in, we can convert it org mode.</p>

<ul>
<li>A temporary buffer is created, which is converted to <code>org-mode</code></li>
<li>The contents of the org document are inserted into the buffer.</li>
<li><code>org-html-export-as-html</code> creates a new buffer, makes it current,
and inserts the exported html into that buffer.</li>
<li><code>princ</code> writes the converted html to stdout.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I am pretty happy with the solution. This is one of the
lesser known areas of Emacs, and I&#39;m really glad that I finally know
how to do it, because it is a problem I have had to deal with on
several occasions. </p>
