                        <p>Emacs Lisp is an enigmatic hacker programming language. Its weaknesses
are well known. It slow. It is single-threaded. Its variables are
dynamically bound. I can go on, but these are the main objections. 
Despite these perceived weaknesses, Emacs Lisp 
is <em>still</em> the most popular Lisp language on github. Many
programmers swear by it. Myself, I probably average writing between 50
and 100 lines of Emacs Lisp daily.</p>

<p>Of course, I decided to invest my time learning it, and I am more than
happy that I did. I really wish I had done so sooner. The mentioned
problems dissuaded me from investing much into the programming
language. But now, I seriously wish I had taken the time to learn it
years ago.</p>

<p>What makes it so awesome, despite the mentioned problems? 
Why should anyone bother learning Emacs Lisp?</p>

<p>So, without further ado, 5 reasons to learn Emacs Lisp today:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Learning almost any amount of Emacs Lisp makes your life better
immediately. What you learn can improve your life <em>right now</em>. Not
one year from now. Not after graduation. Not when your team starts
the next project and you might be able to use this language.</p>

    <p>Many lisp languages are on the theoretical side of the spectrum. That
is great, and it certainly has its place. However, Emacs Lisp is much
more “quick and dirty”. Emacs Lisp is very practical, and helps you
solve your day to day problems.</p>

    <p>If you don’t know any Emacs Lisp, your .emacs file is probably full
with copy-and-paste code that you
used to install packages. Which is normal. The trouble is, this gets
ugly, quickly. Soon your .emacs file becomes really hard to
maintain. Learning Emacs Lisp helps keep your Emacs life sane.</p>

    <p>If you ever need to get any help about Emacs, there is a high chance
that the person who decides to help you will include some Lisp
code. Its pretty hard to tell someone “sorry, I don’t know any elisp”
on ##emacs on freenode. Knowing Emacs Lisp gives you a better grasp
of the community.</p>

    <p>Learn Emacs Lisp. It makes your life better, today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emacs Lisp and Emacs is a really interesting programming
platform. You don’t have to be a rabid Emacs fan to care; I think
anyone would agree that Emacs is objectively interesting.</p>

    <p>Chances are that you have some exposure to the ideas behind
Smalltalk, such as, you know, that whole “objected oriented”
thing. Well, besides Smalltalk as a programming language, it is also a
programming environment. That same remarkably powerful spirit lives
on in Emacs. Just 
about everything is immediately viewable and inspectable by the
user.  Emacs is basically a descendant in spirit of those systems.</p>

    <p>Want to know what a keybinding does? C-h k, and then the
keybinding. Want to know how that function works? C-h f, then the
function name. Want to actually see its source code? Click on the
link that appears in that buffer. Oh, and you can actually modify
it on the fly if you need to, just by changing the function
definition and evaluating it with C-x C-e</p>

    <p>When programming in Emacs Lisp, you get real work done with a system
that is our modern day equivalent of the stuff of legends. Bonus: this system
isn’t just some intellectual exercise. It is practical, awesome, and
immediately useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2012/06/02/emacs-hack-set-todo-done-yesterday.html">Dynamic binding is actually pretty awesome</a>. 
Lets go through a quick
review of what dynamic binding is, exactly, and contrast it with the
other option, lexical binding.</p>

    <p>First, lets talk about variable binding, specifically, in pseudo-Javascript:</p>

    <pre><code>function createAdder(num_to_add)
{
  function(new_num)
  {
    return num_to_add + new_num;
  }
}
   
add2 = createAdder(2);
   
add10 = createAdder(10);
   
   
console.log(add2(6));  //= 8
   
console.log(add10(13));  //= 23
</code></pre>

    <p>Lets discuss this code. createAdder is a function which will return
another function – that is, it “creates” an “adder”. The function
that createAdder returns will add whatever was passed to it (the new
function) and the original number that was passed to createAdder.</p>

    <p>The important point here is that whenever createAdder returns, the
function that gets returned still has access to the argument that was
passed, the num_to_add. Whatever variables are within a parent’s scope
when a function gets created remain available to it for its execution.</p>

    <p>Lexical scope is great. It enables really elegant solutions to
problems, and is what makes Ajax and Node.js sane and possible.</p>

    <p>Dynamic scope is different. With dynamic scope, variables are
bound and evaluated at evaluation time. They get evaluated to whatever
is above in the call stack.</p>

    <p>An example, in a pseudo, now dynamically-scoped Javascript:</p>

    <pre><code>function adder(new_num)
{   
   return num_to_add + new_num;
}

function add2(new_num)
{
   num_to_add = 2;
   return adder(new_num);
}

function add10(new_num)
{
   num_to_add = 10;
   return adder(new_num);
}    

console.log(add2(6));  //= 8

console.log(add10(13));  //= 23
</code></pre>

    <p>The key difference is that within the body of the function adder,
num_to_add does not seem to refer to anything. However, since this
language is dynamically bound, its variables are referenced from where
it gets called. So, the function add2 sets the variable num_to_add,
and when adder is called, it is able to reference it.</p>

    <p>You are probably thinking that this sounds a lot like global
variables. And, it is. This is the reason that most modern languages
are lexically bound, not dynamically.</p>

    <p>In practice it really doesn’t tend to
be that bad. Variables that you are expected to change are well
documented. Code only uses dynamic scope resolution when it needs
to, and typically doesn’t need to very often.</p>

    <p>Dynamic binding is actually really convenient. For example, it allows you
to make variable-based “configuration” changes that only last within a
given scope.</p>

    <p>Besides that, there is also a macro, called lexical-let, which gives
you the functionality you would get with lexical binding.</p>

    <p>If that isn’t enough, Emacs 24 now supports actual lexical scoping. You
just need to set a variable within the elisp file, saying that you
want lexical scoping.</p>

    <p>So. Dynamic scoping is actually pretty cool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Single threading is a good thing. Emacs lisp is single threaded,
and probably forever will be. This is somewhat limiting, however it
does greatly simplify things.</p>

    <p>Enough said. If you really want to deal with locks and their ilk, sorry,
you will have to look elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything about Emacs makes more sense once you understand Emacs
Lisp. You may have noticed that Emacs is extremely self documenting,
and that the documentation is extremely comprehensive. However, much
of that documentation only makes sense within the context of Lisp
code. So, if you don’t understand Emacs Lisp, then much of that
documentation is worthless.</p>

    <p>As an example, to understand the Emacs keybinding system,
you really need to have a grasp on the way that keybindings are
constructed. And, that means Lisp.</p>

    <p>Honestly, Emacs lisp is everywhere in Emacs, and while Emacs can be
really useful without knowing any Lisp, it becomes way more useful
when you understand the native tongue, Emacs Lisp.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, you should learn Emacs lisp. It is a really fascinating
environment to program in and it has the potential to make pieces of
your life much easier. Besides that, to me, the problems of Emacs
Lisp are not significant enough to be truly dissuading – in fact,
most of them can be considered strengths.</p>

<p>In all, Emacs Lisp is a delight to work with, and I cannot recommend
learning it highly enough to anyone who considers themselves a serious
programmer.</p>
