Graham has an interesting point on essays. They are very instructive, very useful for teaching. 

"To try" I often find that, as I start to write an essay, and to formalize my ideas, I end up deciding that I just wasted my time, and that my Ideas were't all that TK word usage= meritorious.

What is more, they end up teaching me something new.
