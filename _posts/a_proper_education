Lets start by stating that, in all likelyhood, your education system is insufficient. I may be incorrect, and if you fundamentally disagree with me, I'm sorry if I offened you. If you, on the other
hand, feel that I am correct, then let us talk. It is beyond the scope of this discussion to debate the relative merits of individual educational systems. 


Education: the transformation of a rational creature from one form to another. 

Education can be of two types, separated by goals. The most common form is the simplistic job-getting model. In this model, a student simply wants to learn for the sake of being successful at their
profession of choice. This is fine; I suppose it is less noble than trying to become a better person, however I do no feel them wrong for feeling this way. 



The second model is the model of trying to be a better person. This aligns itself with the general goal of trying to be the best person possible. Education is a transformative process, and 

We can at least specify what education is supposed to do, in our terms.


What are our goals? Simplistily: soundness of body and soundness of mind


define these both
