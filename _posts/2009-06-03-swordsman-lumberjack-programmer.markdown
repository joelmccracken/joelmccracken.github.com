===============

*A discussion of goals, skills, and tools.*


<blockquote>Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four 
sharpening the axe.

	   --Abraham Lincoln</blockquote>

As paid professionals or as programmer-entrepreneurs, programming is very 
largely goal based. Our success as either is determined by our ability to 
accomplish these goals with both speed and quality.

Skill is a huge factor in success in many professions. For a swordsman, it is almost everything.
A swordsman will die without the proper skills. The cost of failure is 
astronomical.

As programmers, our profession is extremely skill based. There are many ways 
to improve our skills: Take a course, learn a new language, learn a new programming paradigm, 
code something particularly hard (e.g. a compiler or a toy OS), etc. These are all
well known and somewhat obvious ways to improve our skills. University teaches 
these skills. But, is this the only way to get our goals finished faster? 

For the lumberjack, skill is important. Without good form, a less skilled lumberjack
will waste time and energy, accomplishing less. But a good lumberjack will know that
more is required than skill alone: he needs his ax. The quality of his Ax is a
larger determinate of success than his skill. 

The swordsman needs this, too. True, a blunt sword may be good for smacking, and he may
be able to block the attacks of a less skilled opponent for a long time, but he would 
be much more effective with a sharp sword. 

So, too, is this true with programming. Our tools need consideration. These
include our operating system, editor, and source control. 

I am not trying to incite an OS war here; I respect a number of programmers
who use Windows, though I prefer a system that I find to be more flexible. The Linux user
will find Windows to be too simple and constraining; the Windows user will find the
Linux platform to be too close to failure, and possibly the complexities not worthwhile to
deal with. Two things are certain: first, your
operating system and how it will alter your ability to get things done. Second, your 
choice of Windows because it is "better for gaming" does very little to convince
me of your programming prowess. 

Your text editor should have many features that will allow you to constantly advance 
in skill, being better able to manipulate your text files. It should have a large, vibrant, 
active community which has already developed many of the features you require, and it 
should have a good scripting language for you to add whatever feature you need. A good text 
editor will make you *vastly more productive*. While productive likely extends to features
like code highlighting, it most certainly does not end there. 

At this point, the only respectable forms of version control are the decentralized version 
control systems, such as Git or Mercurial, but anything is better than nothing. Learn one
and use it. 

Pick your tools and learn how to use them; otherwise, while you may be a good programmer, 
you certainly will not be as productive as possible.
