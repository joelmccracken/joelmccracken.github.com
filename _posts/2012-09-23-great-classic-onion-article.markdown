# Great Classic Onion Article #
## Since The Beginning Of Time, Mankind Has Discussed What It Did On Summer Vacation ##

Yesterday I ran across this 
[great article from The Onion][onionarticle], and I had to share. I'm
sure most of us remember writing such things in school. I don't know
if any of us would admit (or remember) writing things as bad as this,
but it makes me remember the way we were taught to use a thesis
statement and write an explicit introduction and conclusion. 

The article reminds me of Paul Graham's [The Age of the Essay][age].
The essay as a whole is really powerful, however its starts off with a
criticism of the ways we are taught to write in high school. 

Regardless of your thoughts on his essay, the onion article does a
pretty good job of reminding us that those lessons we learned in
school were rules set to teach us the principles of writing -- that our thoughts
should be organized, our writing should say something, our arguments
should make sense, etc. 

Enjoy the article. It made me smile.
