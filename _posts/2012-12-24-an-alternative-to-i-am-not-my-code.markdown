An Alternative to "I Am Not My Code"
====================================

Code is imperfect. It has warts. It reflects the imperfections and
limitations of its creators. Even though code is imperfect, we still
use it and move forward, because that's the best we can do. 
No matter what we do, code will never be
'perfect', because no meaningful definition of perfection exists. Our
world is a complicated place, and the demands we place on code
reflect this complication. 

Sometimes, we encounter code that someone else is responsible for, and
is lacking in some way. We feel the need
to communicate what we think is wrong with the code. This creates
possible conflict. 

Nobody
likes to hear that their code is bad. 
People in the open source community are here out of passion. They love
programming and want to help others. Programming
deficiencies are an unfortunate part of life. We pour our souls into
our work. When someone criticizes our work, they are criticizing a
source of our pride.

Yet, all code is lacking. We need help from others to identify
problems in our code. This has led some to adopt the mantra, "you are
not your code". The basic idea is that we can criticize the work of
others, and that's ok, because we are criticizing a "thing", not the
authors themselves.

First, of all, I want to say "you are not your code" has some merit. It
encourages us to divorce our sense of 
worth from our code. Indeed, *our* code does have problems -- *all*
code does. If we cannot 
take some criticism, we can't grow as developers and humans. This
is how we learn, after all, and is especially how we learn from other
people. So, we need to be able to talk honestly about code. 

However, "you are not your code" fails in a few ways. First, it does
not acknowledge that the developers actually do care about their
code. Parents are not their children, but that doesn't mean that
parents are fine with people saying bad things about their
kids. We care about our code. And, I think this is a feature, not
a bug. I've seen code written by people who don't care about their
code, and it is unpleasant.

Saying "you are not your code" puts all of the burden on the code
maintainer. It encourages the problem reporter to be careless.
In reality, in any social situation,
everyone has responsibility. Nobody gets to be free of responsibility
for being careless with their tongue.

Besides these sort of fuzzy emotional issues,  "you are not your code"
encourages us to communicate in a way that doesn't really work. For some trivial bug
reports, such as misspellings, a straightforward discussion might solve
the problem. However, most bug reports require much more interaction
between the two parties. Software is really complicated. 
The maintainer and the reporter need to come
to terms and establish a common understanding about the entire situation
that caused the code problem. We can't skip this step.

So, how can we do better? Like so many social issues, the key is
empathy and understanding. Put yourself in the shoes of the
code maintainer. What do you think they need to know? How is it that you know
it? Where does the misunderstanding come from, and how can it be rectified?

As someone who wants to report a problem, answering questions like
this drastically improves the quality of communications. Bug reports
are better. Discussions about architecture and philosophy are more
informative. Really, this lets us compose much better
communications. These well thought out communications are way less offensive
and much more understandable. 

Of course, this is hard. It requires brain power to put
ourselves in the place of the authors. It is certainly much harder
than just saying whatever you want, punctuated with "you are not your
code". However, we still eventually need to come to an understanding
with the other person. Regardless of how they feel about what we say,
they still actually need to understand what the problem is. 
So, why not skip to the end, bypass the part where we make the code author
feel bad, and effectively communicate what we think the author needs
to know?
