title: 'The Struggle Between Specialization and Generalization'
---

Specialization has always seemed suspicious to me. It seems like an
idea of dubious value, with obvious downsides. On the grayscale of
specialization versus generalization, I lean toward generalization. 

Society is filled with cues telling us that we should specialize. 
Like many social cues, this prod to specialize contains a kernel
wisdom. It is based on a worldview which is pretty accurate. We need
money to live. We get money by providing value to others. Society at
its fundamental level is based upon specialization 
and the utility we provide. So, it is a really good idea to make
yourself valuable. 

So, we have this story that we are told. Do well in school. Get
into a good University. Study something that promises a great
career. Get out and start your career, and then stick with it. Then,
enjoy life. Et cetera.

There ideas carry certain implications.
Topics unrelated to your fields are "distractions" that should
be avoided. "Dabbler" is a very negative label. Personal enrichment
is sacrificed for career enrichment. Sure, students will take classes
that they are interested in, but interest is never the primary
motivator. After school is over, most people never read a book, ever
again. They got their job, after all, and now it is time for fun. 

I have many problems with all of this. I do not believe that studying
is a means to an end. Studying, learning, and teaching is one of the highest
of human pursuits. It is by thought and study that we
culture insight and improve ourselves. Teaching each other is as
fundamental to society as can be. 

To be honest, I'm not even convinced that specialization 
guarantees a great career. 
The world is changing, and the rate of change is steepening. 
What happens when our hyper-specialized abilities are no longer useful? Do
we go back and retrain? 

I believe we should focus on improving our skills. We should be trying
to make ourselves better people. People who understand each other
better, people who understand the universe better, and people who
understand life better. 

What kind of skills? Communication skills are valuable to
everyone. By this, I mean reading skills, writing skills, and skills
speaking and listening. Mathematics and logic help us understand and
manipulate our universe, and learning more about these is very
rewarding. Programming is super awesome. It lets you explore all kinds
of ideas that would be impossible otherwise.

Personally, this is my approach to life. I hope I encourage you to
embrace life and learning more fully.
