# Ruby from Lisp-Colored Glasses

I have a troubled relationship with Ruby. I really like to write it,
but it has taken me a while to come to terms with Ruby.

I love to programming, but with a specific twist. One thing to love
about programming is the
career possibilies available to great programmers. Another is
the possibility to produce things that peope love. One reason to love
programming is the good that it lets you do for others and have a
positive impact on society. 

However, none of these really describe me. They each are an important
part of why I love programming, but not exclusive or even primary. They each contribute to a
fascination with programming as a whole. I believe programming is new thing,
which is distinct than any other discipline. To program well is to
have a good understanding of writing, design, science, and
math. There are also very open questions in our field: How do we write
better code? What makes code better than other code? What does code
mean about human thought? What can code, thought, and its relatinoship
teach us about reality and universe itself? 

From this point of view, languages that are high in theory, such as
Lisp and Haskell, make sense. They let you explore the nature of
programming in ways that more "traditional" langauges do not. Ruby
sits at an intersection here. While Ruby does not give you the power
over the written syntax, it does give you the power to
do quite a bit with what the syntax 'means'. This really requires a
larger discussion about Ruby domain-specific languages, however,
the essence is that Ruby lets you do The Right Thing as far as DLSs are
concerned.

There is one more really important point to this: I am a recovering 
[unix hater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UNIX-HATERS_Handbook).
I wont get into the details of my personal unix hatred, as that
belongs in another post, but the
recovery process has been interesting. Unix-hating is good for sport
but poor for productivity. The only real way to get any work done is
to embrace it. Ruby has played a pivotal role in this. I don't feel
constrained by the language -- whenever I see a problem, the means to
solve it the best way I know how are very possible. On the other hand,
Ruby feels very natural as a Unix citizen. The cognitive dissonance
that arises from working with a Lisp language and working with Unix
basically recedes into the background.

If you love Lisp, it is really easy to hate on Unix. If you are one of
those haters, Ruby is a really good way to start your recovery, if you
are interested.  

Basically, it comes down to this: Any programming language involves
some tradeoffs. Admittedly, using Ruby means you lose some theoretical possibility
for expressiveness. However, for practical, day-to-day, get-it-done
programming, Ruby has made those tradeoffs almost perfectly.
