title: A Simple Web App in Rust, Part 1
---
* Intro & Background
What is it like to write a tiny web app in Rust from
the perspective of an experienced programmer who is new to the ecosystem?
Read on to find out.

I've been interested in Rust since I first heard about it. A systems
language that supports macros & has room to grow towards higher-level
abstractions? Awesome.

So far, I have only written read blog posts about Rust & done some
very basic "hello world" style programs. So, I guess I'm saying that
my perspective is pretty raw.

A while back I saw [[http://artyom.me/learning-racket-1][this article]] about learning Racket, and I thought
it was really great. We need more people writing about their
experiences as beginners with a technology, especially those who
already have a fair amount of experience with
technology [fn:experience]. I also liked its stream-of-consciousness
approach, and think it would be a nice experiment to write one for
Rust.

So, with the preliminaries out of the way, let's get started.

[fn:experience] I'm not trying to say that the experiences of
beginners is not valuable -- far from it! However, I do think those
experiences bring a separate set of insights than those from someone
who has been programming for a long time, and they may notice how
non-standard some things in an ecosystem are.


* The App
The app I want to build serves a simple need of mine: A
brain-dead-easy way to record when I take my medication each day. I
want tap a link on my home screen and have it record the visit, and
this will preserve a record of when I've taken my medication.

Rust seems to be suited for this app. It's fast. Running a single,
simple server takes relatively
few resources, so it won't be taxing to my VPS. And, I have wanted to
do something more real with Rust.

The MVP is very small, but there room for it to grow if I want to add
more features. Sounds perfect.
* The Plan
So, I'm going to quickly admit something here: I lost an earlier
version of this project. This has some disadvantages: as I recreate
this, I won't have the same level of unfamiliarity I did when I
approached it some weeks ago. However, I think I remember those pain
points, and will do my best to recreate them.

However, there is one thing that I learned that I want to apply here:
it is much easier to build separate, individual programs while
exploring APIs instead of trying to do everything all at once.

To that end, I have the following plan:
1. Build a simple web server that displays "hello world" when I
   visit.
2. Build a tiny program that logs the formatted date and time whenever
   it is run.
3. Integrate the two into a single application.
4. Deploy this application to my server, a Digital Ocean VPS.
* Writing The "Hello World" Web App

So, I'm starting an empty git repo & have homebrew installed. Lets
install Rust. I know this much, at least.
** Installing Rust

#+END_SRC


Oook, before anything else, lets do a regular "hello world" program.


#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cat > hello_world.rs
fn main() {

        println!("hello world");
}
^D
$ rustc hello_world.rs
$ ./hello_world
hello world
$
#+END_SRC

So far, so good. Rust is working! Or, at least, the compiler is.

A friend suggested I try [[http://nickel.rs/][nickle.rs]] as a web application framework for
Rust. It looks good to me!

As of today, the first example it uses is:

#+BEGIN_SRC
#[macro_use] extern crate nickel;

use nickel::Nickel;

fn main() {
    let mut server = Nickel::new();

    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            "Hello world!"
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}
#+END_SRC

So, the first time I did this, I got a little side tracked and learned
a bit about cargo. This time, I notice that there's this
[[http://nickel.rs/getting-started.html]["getting started" link]], so I think I'll try that instead of getting
everything set up on my own.

There's a script that I'm supposed to ~curl~ and pipe into a root
shell, but that makes me paranoid so I'm going to download it and look
over it first.

#+BEGIN_SRC
curl -LO https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh
#+END_SRC


Ok, this actually doesn't look like its going to do what I want. At
least, there's a lot going on in this script, more than I want to deal
with right now. Hmm. I /wonder/ if ~cargo~ got installed with ~rustc~?

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ which cargo
/usr/local/bin/cargo
$ cargo -v
Rust's package manager

Usage:
    cargo <command> [<args>...]
    cargo [options]

Options:
    -h, --help       Display this message
    -V, --version    Print version info and exit
    --list           List installed commands
    -v, --verbose    Use verbose output

Some common cargo commands are:
    build       Compile the current project
    clean       Remove the target directory
    doc         Build this project's and its dependencies' documentation
    new         Create a new cargo project
    run         Build and execute src/main.rs
    test        Run the tests
    bench       Run the benchmarks
    update      Update dependencies listed in Cargo.lock
    search      Search registry for crates

See 'cargo help <command>' for more information on a specific command.
#+END_SRC

Ok, that looks good I guess? I'll go with it for now.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ rm rustup.sh
#+END_SRC

** Setting Up the Project

So, the next step is to generate a new project directory. But I
already have a project directory =(. I'll try it like this, anyway.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo new . --bin
Destination `/Users/joel/Projects/simplelog/.` already exists
#+END_SRC

Ugh, that didn't work.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo -h
Create a new cargo package at <path>

Usage:
    cargo new [options] <path>
    cargo new -h | --help

Options:
    -h, --help          Print this message
    --vcs <vcs>         Initialize a new repository for the given version
                        control system (git or hg) or do not initialize any version
                        control at all (none) overriding a global configuration.
    --bin               Use a binary instead of a library template
    --name <name>       Set the resulting package name
    -v, --verbose       Use verbose output

#+END_SRC

Yeah, it doesn't look like this is going to do what I want it to. Blah
I guess I'll just redo this repo.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cd ../
$ rm -rf simplelog/
$ cargo new simple-log --bin
$ cd simple-log/
#+END_SRC


Ok, what's up in here?

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ tree
.
|____.git
| |____config
| |____description
| |____HEAD
| |____hooks
| | |____README.sample
| |____info
| | |____exclude

| | |____pack
| |____refs

|____Cargo.toml
|____src
| |____main.rs
#+END_SRC

So, it made a git repository, ~Cargo.toml~ and a ~main.rs~ in a ~src~
directory. Sounds fine to me.

Next on the nickel getting started page,
I add the ~nickel.rs~ dependency to the cargo file, and it now looks
like:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[package]
name = "simple-log"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Joel McCracken <mccracken.joel@gmail.com>"]

[dependencies.nickel]

git = "https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs.git"

#+END_SRC

This makes sense, I think. I'm not sure what
"dependencies.nickel" is actually /saying/. Is ~dependencies~ a hash
with a ~nickel~ key? I do get that I'm saying "get nickel from here,
yo".

** The "Hello World" Example Running

Anyway, moving on and pasting the example into ~main.rs~:

#+BEGIN_SRC
#[macro_use] extern crate nickel;

use nickel::Nickel;

fn main() {
    let mut server = Nickel::new();

    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            "Hello world!"
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}

#+END_SRC

So, what's the deal with ~macro_use~, ~extern~, and then needing to
~use~? All stuff I will figure out later.

/Oh snap/, I had a few sentences about how ~macro_use~ was probably a
macro-time directive[fn:macro-time], but I didn't see any actual
macros, so I deleted it. Now I see ~router!~, though, so I'm even more
inclined to think this is a macro directive. Also, I doubt
the term 'directive' is correct, so don't pick it up.

Lets try it:

^C
#+END_SRC

Woo hoo! Visiting ~localhost:6767~ in my browser worked.


[fn:macro-time] I would normally say
'compile-time' directive, but that doesn't make much sense since Rust
is a compiled language. So, I say 'macro-time' directive, but I really
have no idea.

** One Final Challenge

Ok, now I want to try one thing and then call it a night: can I move
the "hello world" into its own function? Baby steps, after all.

#+BEGIN_SRC
fn say_hello() {
    "Hello dear world!";
}

fn main() {
    let mut server = Nickel::new();

    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            say_hello();
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}
#+END_SRC

Err... when I run it this time, I see "Not found". Let me try
fiddling with semicolons just in case that's important:

#+BEGIN_SRC
fn say_hello() {
    "Hello dear world!"
}

fn main() {
    let mut server = Nickel::new();

    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            say_hello()
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}
#+END_SRC

Ok... now I have a completely different error message:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo run
   Compiling simple-log v0.1.0 (file:///Users/joel/Projects/simple-log)
src/main.rs:6:5: 6:24 error: mismatched types:
 expected `()`,
    found `&'static str`
(expected (),
    found &-ptr) [E0308]
src/main.rs:6     "Hello dear world!"
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `simple-log`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
#+END_SRC


So, I /guess/ the presence/absence of the semicolon was important. And
now I'm getting a type error, at least. Oh, and I'm 90% sure that ~()~
is referring to what I remember to be 'unit', the Rust idea of
undefined, nil, or whatever. I'm sure this isn't quite right, but I
guess it makes sense.

I /assumed/ Rust would do type inferencing. Does it not? Or does it
just not do it around function boundaries? Hmm.

So, the error message is telling me that it expected the return value
to be unit, but the actual return value was a static string(?). I'm
pretty sure I've seen the syntax for specifying return value types;
let me see:

#+BEGIN_SRC
#[macro_use] extern crate nickel;

use nickel::Nickel;

fn say_hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello dear world!"
}

fn main() {
    let mut server = Nickel::new();

    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            say_hello()
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}
#+END_SRC

The type ~&'static str~ looks very weird to me. Does it compile? Does
it work?

#+BEGIN_SRC

$ cargo run &
[1] 14997
Running `target/debug/simple-log`
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:6767
Ctrl-C to shutdown server
$ curl http://localhost:6767
Hello dear world!
$ fg
cargo run
^C
#+END_SRC


Yay, it worked! This time around, Rust hasn't been /that/ frustrating. I'm not
sure if its because I'm more familiar with some of this tooling, or
I've opted to read documentation more, but I'm having fun. Also, the
difference between /reading/ a language and /writing/ in a
language sometimes very surprising. While I understand these code
examples, I can't make edits quickly and effectively.

Next up, we will work through the process of writing the current date
to a file. This can be found [[http://joelmccracken.github.io/entries/a-simple-web-app-in-rust-pt-2a][here]].
