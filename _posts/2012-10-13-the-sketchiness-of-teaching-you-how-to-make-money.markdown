title: 'The Sketchiness of "Teaching you how to Make Money"'
---

Do you remember those infomercials on late night television that are
trying to sell viewers a way to make money? Most of them involved
buying and selling real estate, but I am pretty sure I saw other
types. They always featured testimonials by people who used the system
to make many thousands of dollars. 

To me, those always seemed a little bit sketchy. First, they 
seemed too polished. I understand that polish is necessary to seem
(and to actually be) professional, but there is a very subtle
difference between professional and con-artisty. And, if the
difference is not pronounced enough, it sets off a lot of my mental
alarms. Some questions immediately are raised: If you are so
successful from investing in real estate, how is it worth your time to
get on the television and try to sell me a course that took you all
this time to put together? For that matter, isn't the amount of
valuable real estate limited? And, why aren't you able to scale up
your operations to take advantage of all this opportunity?

I want to be clear. I have no real reason to suspect these courses. 
The people selling them were probably genuine. Thing is, they also set
off alarm bells, which the programs would never really assuage.

Nowadays, there are lots of people online who are selling
courses to bootstrap web services. I have interacted with some of
them, and they seem like really great people. 
The thing is, these types of services set off those same mental
alarms. To me, at least. 

What could you do to help me, as a potential customer, overcome these
biases? One way would be 
to give some hard figures about student success and success
stories. Ideally, these success 
stories would include links to real websites that were built after
completing your course. I'd like to "see" what the course would do for
me. 

What if you don't have/can't provide any of this information? Well, I
guess I wouldn't be your ideal customer. But, you should try to get
this information, because my
guess is that I am not all that unique in feeling this way. You,
personally, could always start smaller, possibly with a single client
with the understanding that they will be willing to provide this
information for future marketing purposes. 

Ultimately, this kind of sales/marketing strategy has a really long history, and
any kind of service that employs similar strategies has an uphill
battle to fight. I think that services like these are probably
extremely useful and valuable -- if potential customers can see past
the initial distrust of services that market themselves like this.
