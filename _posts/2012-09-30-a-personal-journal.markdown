Part of my personal problems with blogging lie with you, the
reader. 

I just don't know who you are. Every time I write something,
I am making a guess about you -- that you care about Ruby,
Emacs, education, etc. The truth is, though, that much of this may
not be true about any of you, and certainly isn't true about all of
you. And, when I publish something on another 
topic, I know that this won't be true of many of the readers that I
wrote for with a previous post. 

This is a problem for me. When I write, I try to think about the
reader. This effects my topic choice, my style, and the depth that
I attempt 
to cover the information.

I also notice this on a number of other blogs. Lots of developers who
write create mixed content. And, I personally find some of the
content interesting and some irrelevant. If you look at the advice on
websites like ProBlogger, etc, you see that "the goal" of a blogger is
to discover a niche and write for it. 

I'm an eclectic person, and no single niche could hold my
interest. It's just not possible. And, I don't think it is worth it,
even if it was. Why give up on the variety of things that life has
just to specialize in a single area? 

So, I'm going to try something different. This blog is going to be my
personal blog. It'll have content that is personally important and
interesting to me, as well as "air out" thoughts and impressions. I'm
not going to try to stick to any single topic, because this hasn't
worked for me so far. My "measuring stick" will consist of whatever topic is
interesting to me. Eventually I hope to build topics into separate, audience-specific
blogs, as I find enough reader
interest in them, and have enough personal interest to continue
creating content.

Emacs is probably my primary passion at the moment. Emacs has its
warts, but most of these are going away, and at a rapid, awesome
pace. Emacs is no longer just a text editor. It is quickly moving to
become a compelling lisp environment for general development. This
will probably be the first separate blog I create. 

I have a lot of interest in Ruby, too. Ruby rests at an intersection
between many different programming traditions, has developed its own
vibrant tradition, and is a very viable language to get paid to use. 

Ultimately, my programming passions reside in what I would term
"Advanced Programming". I am interested in different programming
techniques. 
I think there are some deep
truths about thought, reality, and nature to be found. Ultimately, I
think understanding these things will provide answers to open the open
questions about programming. 

Of course, life is full of interesting things that have nothing to do with
programming -- things such as philosophy, literature, music, and
mathematics. I will probably will end up writing about these topics
mostly on this blog, since they are personal, interesting, and I don't
really think they apply to any specific group of people, besides the
generic catchall "geeky people who love learning".

I think these topics may end up developing into a sort of "independent
scholar" blog. There are many people who are interested in learning,
but have no affiliation with any academic institution. Many people are
dissatisfied with higher education. I, personally, am glad to be away
from it. There are some things that I really liked about college. The
academic world isn't was worth it, though. It costs too much in time,
stress, and money. 

I feel better, like a number of questions that I have been wondering
about are resolved. Thanks for reading.
