title: 'Book Reaction: Introducing "How to Read a Book"'
---


Reading is hard. Even though we already know how to read, I, for one,
wish I was better at it. I suspect many of you do, too. 
For example, have you ever read a story but cant remember some 
details of the story? Or, have you ever read something and gotten
lost, unable to follow the author's point? Have you ever read
something and genuinely enjoyed it, but had trouble explaining to a
friend exactly why you liked it so much?

Like many geeks, I have always been an avid reader. Thus, when I first
came across a ["How to Read a Book"][HTRAB] (hereafter, HTRAB), I was
intrigued. It promised to 
teach the reader how to improve their comprehension of what they read,
as well as retain that knowledge better. 

The problems mentioned at the outset are extremely frustrating. Its
irritating to read a book, 
but then realize that you've forgotten most of what you learned from
it a few years later. Or, you are stuck and confused, but you really
have no good plan to resolve your confusion. So, you plow on ahead,
hoping the confusion works itself out. 
Reading is the primary way that we share knowledge with each
other. Reading well is of vital importance to all humans. I personally
identify myself as a life-long, independent learner. I 
love reading and learning, so my ability to understand what I read is
fundamental to how I view myself.

Thankfully, HTRAB is here to help us become better readers! 
It teaches techniques to
judge a book before investing too much time into it: what kind of book
is it? Is its goal to teach me 
how to do something, or to describe the way the world is? Is this book
worth reading right now, or should I let it sit on a shelf till a
later date? 

Once you start reading, HTRAB teaches you to
identify the key topics that an author is discussing and sketch an
outline of the discussion. It also suggests an effective technique for
marginalia, and finally, by the time you are done, you know when
you've gotten all that you can from a book.  

Finally, it gives you an outline on how to compose the information given
by a book with information from other sources. HTRAB helps you follow
the lines of argument across different authors, books, and time-periods.

Fundamentally, HTRAB challenges the reader to think about the
way they read. It also encourages them to consider what reading
is, what it means to us them individually, as well as what reading means to society in
general.

I highly recommend studying it. If you do get a chance to read it, I
would really like to hear what you think. Or, if you have already read
it, it would be great to hear what you think about it now.
