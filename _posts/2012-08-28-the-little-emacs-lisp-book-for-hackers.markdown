# The Little Emacs Lisp Book for Hackers #


A while ago I started to learn Emacs Lisp, and it has
been a surprising journey. It has also been an enjoyable journey.

I wouldn't say that its been an easy, though. There is a ton of elisp
out there, and lots of guides to programming in Emacs. 

The thing is, I think Emacs is important. To me, Emacs is the best
computing environment to live in that is available today. 

Plus, it is only getting better. With the release of the Emacs Lisp
Package Archive, the community has a sane, standard way to distribute
and manage the Elisp packages in use.

So, I'm  create a "guidebook" to help. I hope to keep it as brief
and as enjoyable as possible. Some people seem to like the
read-the-whole-manual approach, but I don't. I think concise, clear,
directed guides are what our future hackers need.

Its going to be free / open source. For now, I'm just going to
prototype it over my Journal. I look at blogging as exploratory
book-writing anyway, so it makes perfect sense. 

I'll update this page with links to new content as it becomes
available, but if you would like to see content as it comes out,
subscribe via RSS, or follow me on twitter. 

Thanks for reading, 

Joel

[Why you should learn Emacs Lisp](/2012/05/23/why-you-should-learn-elisp.html)
is a brief summary of the reasons Emacs Lisp is actually better than
you probably think, and worth your time to learn. 

[Lisp Essentials](/2012/05/26/emacs-lisp-for-hackers-part-1-lisp-essentials.html)
covers the basics of lisp, if you are completely unfamiliar with any
Lisp. I assume that you are smart and can already program well, but
Lisp is a rather strange programming language. Think of this as
"chapter zero".

[Emacs Documentation](/2012/08/18/emacs-lisp-for-hackers-part-2-emacs-documentation.html)
is an introduction to emacs self-documenting features. Use it to get
started quickly with Emacs documentation system.
