I just completed the transition back to plain Jekyll from
Octopress. There are a few reasons for this change:

1. Octopress was broken in a way that I couldn't resolve.
1. Jekyll has been seeing a ton of activity lately, and I like those
   features.
2. Octopress doesn't support any kind of modern Jekyll.
3. Conversely, Octopress hasn't seen much activity in a long time.
3. Octopress' templating standards is very compliated and indirect,
   and has frustrated me in the past. 

I did spend some time trying to make a newer Jekyll work with
Octopress, but it was hard and I kept running into new problems.

I *was* able to pull much of the code that I did appreciate from
Octopress' Rakefile into my own. So, for now, I feel like I am able to
take advantage of the things I liked about Octopress.
