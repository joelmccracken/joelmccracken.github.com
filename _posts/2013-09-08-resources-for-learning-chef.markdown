I've been learning more about Chef recently.
Chef is a big part of my goals to
[get my workstation under control](/entries/your-workstation-is-a-massive-technical-debt/)
and to
[work on fixing the interenet](/entries/lets-fix-the-internet/)
by making it easy for a person to have his own server.

In January 2013, learing Chef was hard. The documentation was lacking, and what documentation
did exist tended to be really vague.
Recently I started looking around for resources again, and this is starting to change. The
"[Getting Started with Chef](http://gettingstartedwithchef.com/)"
book has been great for explaining chef concepts with a focus on
concrete examples which build upon one another.

Additionally, the chef resources from Opscode have been getting better.
"[Learn Chef](https://learnchef.opscode.com/)" is really awesome in almost the same
way as "Getting Started with Chef",
and the [Chef docs](http://docs.opscode.com/) are much more polished and complete than
they were in January.

I am really impressed by these improvements. I once had a really hard time
learning Chef. Just a few months later, the documentation is much better and I could
see a novice having a much easier time getting started.

If you have been thinking about learning and using Chef for one of your projects,
you should really look into it. The resources I linked above are more
than enough to support you.
