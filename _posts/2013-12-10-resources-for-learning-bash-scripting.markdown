*May 04, 2014: Added Matt Might's Bash By Example*

I have an intense love-hate relationship with Bash.
It sure feels like achieving reasonable proficiency at Bash has been
the hardest and most frustrating thing in my professional career thus
far. Yet, it is extremely rewarding. Bash is extremely effective in
certain situations. This effectiveness is what has enticed me to keep
at it.

There are many things about Bash that make it awkward. Knowing where
to look for answers is really invaluable. Most of these actually come
from #bash on Freenode. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the channel
itself as I have had bad experiences. Still, these resources are the
the clearest and most useful I have found.


1. [The Bash manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)
   is surprisingly complete and clear. It provides a good first
   reference for variables, substitutions, and other Bash nuances.

2. The
   [Bash Guide](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide)
   is provides a reasonable general overview of Bash. This is a great
   orientation to the world of shell scripting.

2. The Bash FAQ. You will encouter behavior in Bash that is
   baffling. My first real understanding of the complexities in Bash
   came from looking at the
   ["I'm trying to put a command in a variable, but the complex cases always fail!"](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/050)
   Bash FAQ entry. These entries are great for clearing up
   confusion. The same goes for the
   [Bash Pitfalls](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls)
   reference.

3. [Matt Might's bash by example](http://matt.might.net/articles/bash-by-example/)
   is probably my new favorite resource.




Hopefully you, dear reader, will have an easier time than I
wrangling the beast that is Bash.
