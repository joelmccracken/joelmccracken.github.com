title: Backup Your Data, Kids
---

Last weekend, I deleted a directory that was "empty" that included
some of my personal data.

I use empty with scare quotes because the directory wasn't actually
empty. I don't know what exactly caused it, but OS X was listing the
directory as empty. I was trying to figure out what was going on with
something else, noticed the directory, thought it was some junk
directory I never actually used, deleted it, and then a few minutes
later that a /number/ of directories were mysteriously empty. I
restarted computer and they all came back.

I didn't lose that much data because I do keep most things in
git. However, there were a few projects that I had been working on
recently that I hadn't pushed remotely.

My personal lesson is to not have things that I want to keep not
backed up, no matter how short a time it will be. I know, I know, this
is obvious, common advice, but still.
