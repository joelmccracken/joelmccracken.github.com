title: A Simple Web App in Rust, Part 4 -- CLI Option Parsing
layout: post
---

* Back from Hiatus

Hello! Sorry for the delay in this one. My wife and I just bought a
house, and we have been dealing with all that. Thanks for your
patience.

* Intro

Last time, we built a "working" application; the proof-of-concept is
there. In order to make it into something that could actually be used,
we need to worry about some other things like adding command line
options.

So, I'm
going to do some command parsing. But first, lets move this existing
code out of the way to have a "blank slate" to do some CLI parsing
experimentation.
But, even before that, lets just generally clean things up a bit by
removing some old files, and then creating a new ~main.rs~:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ls
Cargo.lock      Cargo.toml      log.txt         src             target
$ cd src/
$ ls
main.rs                 main_file_writing.rs    web_main.rs
#+END_SRC

~main_file_writing.rs~ and ~web_main.rs~ are both old, so I can remove
them. After that I'll move ~main.rs~ to, say, ~main_logging_server.rs~
and create a new ~main.rs~.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ git rm main_file_writing.rs web_main.rs
rm 'src/main_file_writing.rs'
rm 'src/web_main.rs'
$ git commit -m 'remove old files'
[master 771380b] remove old files
 2 files changed, 35 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 src/main_file_writing.rs
 delete mode 100644 src/web_main.rs
$ git mv main.rs main_logging_server.rs
$ git commit -m 'move main out of the way for cli parsing experiment'
[master 4d24206] move main out of the way for cli parsing experiment
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename src/{main.rs => main_logging_server.rs} (100%)
$ touch main.rs
#+END_SRC


On to parameter parsing. In the comments section of an earlier post,
[[http://blog.ssokolow.com/][Stephan Sokolow]] asked if I had considered using the package [[https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs][clap]] for
command line parsing. Clap looks interesting, so, I'll try it.

* Requirements

The service needs to be parameterized for the following:

1. The location of the log file.
2. A secret token to authenticate with.
3. (Possibly) setting the time zone to use with logging.

I just checked the Digital Ocean VM that I'm planning to use this on,
and the machine is in EST, which is also my time zone, so I'll
probably skip number 3, for now.

* Implementation

As far as I can tell, the way to specify /this/ dependency is via
~clap = "*";~. I'd always rather specify one, specific version, but
for now "*" will work.

My new Cargo.toml:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[package]
name = "simple-log"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Joel McCracken <mccracken.joel@gmail.com>"]

[dependencies]

chrono = "0.2"
clap   = "*"

[dependencies.nickel]

git = "https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs.git"
#+END_SRC


Installing the dependency:

#+BEGIN_SRC

#+END_SRC

The error is just because my ~main.rs~ file is still empty; the
important part is that the "Compiling clap" things look good.

Based upon the README, I'll try the very simple version listed:

#+BEGIN_SRC
extern crate clap;

  let _ = App::new("fake").version("v1.0-beta").get_matches();
}

I don't know why the readme told me to compile with ~--release~ -- it
looks like the ~debug~ worked the same way. Unless I don't understand
what's going on. Lemmie rm the target dir, then try again without the
release flag:

#+END_SRC

So, I guess you don't need that ~--release~ flag. Ya learn something
new every day.

Also, looking at the ~main~ code again, I notice that the variable is
named ~_~; I assume this must be in order to silence warnings/signify
disuse. Using ~_~ to signify "intentionally unused" is pretty
standard, I like that Rust supports this.

So, based upon the clap readme and a little experimentation, I've come
up with this first attempt at writing an argument parser:


#+BEGIN_SRC
extern crate clap;
use clap::{App,Arg};

fn main() {
    let matches = App::new("simple-log").version("v0.0.1")
        .arg(Arg::with_name("LOG FILE")
             .short("l")
             .long("logfile")
             .takes_value(true))
        .get_matches();

    println!("Logfile path: {}", matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap());

}

#+END_SRC

=>

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo run -- --logfile whodat
     Running `target/debug/simple-log --logfile whodat`
Logfile path: whodat
$ cargo run -- -l whodat
     Running `target/debug/simple-log -l whodat`
Logfile path: whodat
#+END_SRC

Ok, so that worked! But here's a problem:


#+BEGIN_SRC $ cargo run
$ cargo run
     Running `target/debug/simple-log`
thread '<main>' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', /private/tmp/rust2015051
6-38954-h579wb/rustc-1.0.0/src/libcore/option.rs:362
An unknown error occurred

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
#+END_SRC

So. Calling ~unwrap()~ up there was a bad idea, since this argument
may not be passed in!

I'm not sure what the opinion of the greater Rust community is on
~unwrap~, but everywhere I've noticed it there is also a comment
explaining why it should be OK to use here. While I think that makes
sense, as an application grows it is easy for assumptions in one place
to become invalidated. And, notice that the error occurs at
/run-time/. This isn't something that the compiler can determine!

Is ~unwrap~ the same basic idea as there being a null pointer
exception? I think so. But, it does make you stop and
think about what you're doing, and if it means that ~unwrap~ is a code
sort-of-smell, then that's great. Which leads me to a bit of a rant:

* A Rant

I firmly believe that you cannot make developers write good
code. The problem I have with static language communities is that the
rhetoric around these programming languages: that they will "prevent the programmer
from doing bad things". Well, guess what: that's impossible.

Firstly, you cannot define "good code" in any sensible way. Indeed, much of
what makes code good is highly context-dependent. As a very basic
example, sloppy code is good when prototyping, but sloppy code is
horrible when making something production-quality.

The latest OpenSSL vulnerability is a great example of this.
I didn't read very much into the news about the vulnerability,
but from what I gathered, the cause of the bug was
/an error in business logic/. Under certain very-specific
circumstances, an attacker could become a certificate authority. How
do you write a compiler that prevents /this/ problem?

Indeed, this takes me back to an old quote from Charles Babbage:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On two occasions I have been asked, — "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put
into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" In
one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the
Lower, House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the
kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.
#+END_QUOTE

The best thing that you can do is make it /easier/ for developers to write
good code. Doing the right thing should be the normal, easy path.

Once you start talking about static type systems as tools to make
programming /easier/, I think things start to make sense again. In the end,
the developer is still responsible for doing the right thing, and we
must /trust/ them and /empower/ them to do these things.

Finally: the programmer can always implement a little
Scheme interpreter and write all their application logic in that. Good
luck trying to get your type checker to prevent that sort of thing.

Ok, I'm done. I'll get down off my soapbox. Thanks for indulging me.

* Continuing

Back in the real world, I notice that there is an option for an ~Arg~
that specifies that the argument is required. I think I'd like to use
that here:

#+BEGIN_SRC
extern crate clap;
use clap::{App,Arg};

fn main() {
    let matches = App::new("simple-log").version("v0.0.1")
        .arg(Arg::with_name("LOG FILE")
             .short("l")
             .long("logfile")
             .required(true)
             .takes_value(true))
        .get_matches();

    println!("Logfile path: {}", matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap());

}

#+END_SRC

=>

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo run
   Compiling simple-log v0.1.0 (file:///Users/joel/Projects/simple-log)
     Running `target/debug/simple-log`
error: The following required arguments were not supplied:
        '--logfile <LOG FILE>'

USAGE:
        simple-log --logfile <LOG FILE>

An unknown error occurred

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
$ cargo run -- -l whodat
     Running `target/debug/simple-log -l whodat`
Logfile path: whodat
#+END_SRC

It works! The next we need option is to specify a secret token via the
command line.
Lets add that, but make it optional because, well, why
not? I might want to put up an open version of this for people to see.

I'm left with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
extern crate clap;
use clap::{App,Arg};

fn main() {
    let matches = App::new("simple-log").version("v0.0.1")
        .arg(Arg::with_name("LOG FILE")
             .short("l")
             .long("logfile")
             .required(true)
             .takes_value(true))
        .arg(Arg::with_name("AUTH TOKEN")
             .short("t")
             .long("token")
             .takes_value(true))
        .get_matches();

    let logfile_path = matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap();
    let auth_token   = matches.value_of("AUTH TOKEN");
}

There are a lot of (expected) warnings, but it compiles and
runs fine. I just wanted it to type-check. Now lets bring this back to
the real program. I start with the code below:

#+BEGIN_SRC
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::fs::OpenOptions;
use std::io;

#[macro_use] extern crate nickel;
use nickel::Nickel;

extern crate chrono;
use chrono::{DateTime,Local};

fn formatted_time_entry() -> String {
    let local: DateTime<Local> = Local::now();
    let formatted = local.format("%a, %b %d %Y %I:%M:%S %p\n").to_string();
    formatted
}

fn record_entry_in_log(filename: &str, bytes: &[u8]) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = try!(OpenOptions::new().
                        append(true).
                        write(true).
                        create(true).
                        open(filename));
    try!(file.write_all(bytes));
    Ok(())
}

fn log_time(filename: &'static str) -> io::Result<String> {
    let entry = formatted_time_entry();
    {
        let bytes = entry.as_bytes();

        try!(record_entry_in_log(filename, &bytes));
    }
    Ok(entry)
}

fn do_log_time(logfile_path: &'static str, auth_token: Option<&str>) -> String {
    match log_time(logfile_path) {
        Ok(entry) => format!("Entry Logged: {}", entry),
        Err(e) => format!("Error: {}", e)
    }
}

        .arg(Arg::with_name("AUTH TOKEN")
             .short("t")
             .long("token")

        .get_matches();

    let logfile_path = matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap();
    let auth_token   = matches.value_of("AUTH TOKEN");

    let mut server = Nickel::new();

    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");

I don't understand what is wrong -- this is essentially the same code
as from the example.
I tried commenting out a bunch of code besides what is essentially this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
fn main() {
    let matches = App::new("simple-log").version("v0.0.1")
        .arg(Arg::with_name("LOG FILE")
             .short("l")
             .long("logfile")
             .required(true)
             .takes_value(true))
        .arg(Arg::with_name("AUTH TOKEN")
             .short("t")
             .long("token")
             .takes_value(true))
        .get_matches();

    let logfile_path = matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap();
    let auth_token   = matches.value_of("AUTH TOKEN");
}
#+END_SRC

... and now it compiles. There are lots of warnings, but that's fine.

None of the error messages above refer to any lines that are commented
out. Now that I know that the error message do not refer to what is
causing the problem, I know to look elsewhere.

The first thing I do is remove the references to those two
variables. The code becomes this:


#+BEGIN_SRC
fn main() {
    let matches = App::new("simple-log").version("v0.0.1")
        .arg(Arg::with_name("LOG FILE")
             .short("l")
             .long("logfile")
             .required(true)
             .takes_value(true))
        .arg(Arg::with_name("AUTH TOKEN")
             .short("t")
             .long("token")
             .takes_value(true))
        .get_matches();

    let logfile_path = matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap();
    let auth_token   = matches.value_of("AUTH TOKEN");


    let mut server = Nickel::new();
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time("", Some(""))
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}
#+END_SRC

This compiles and runs correctly. Now that I know this is the problem,
I /suspect/ that this is because the get request is routing to the
~get **~ closure, and importing these variables into a closure would
clearly impact their lifetimes.

I talked with my friend [[https://twitter.com/Carols10cents][Carol Nichols]] about the problem, and she was
able to suggest something that got me one step closer: convert
~logfile_path~ and ~auth_token~ to ~String~ types.

What I believe is going on here is that ~logfile_path~ and
~auth_token~ are both borrowed ~str~ types from somewhere inside the
~matches~ data structure, which goes out of scope... some time. At the
end of ~main~? Since ~main~ should still be running
while the closure exists, it seems like ~matches~ should still exist.

Alternatively, it might be that closures just don't work with
borrows. This seems /unlikely/ to me. It seems more likely that the
compiler can't /prove/ that ~matches~ will still exist while closure
could still be invoked. Although this /still/ doesn't make sense,
since the closure is passed into ~server~, which would go out of scope
at the same time as ~matches~!

But anyway, changing this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    // ...
    let logfile_path = matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap();
    let auth_token   = matches.value_of("AUTH TOKEN");

    let mut server = Nickel::new();
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
        }
    });
    // ...
#+END_SRC

into this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    // ...
    let logfile_path = matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap().to_string();
    let auth_token = match matches.value_of("AUTH TOKEN") {
        Some(str) => Some(str.to_string()),
        None => None
    };

    let mut server = Nickel::new();
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
    // ...
#+END_SRC

... fixed the problem. I also had to change the various functions that
take ~&str~ types to take ~String~ types.

Of course, this reveals a /new/ problem:

At first glance, this error doesn't make any sense to me:

#+BEGIN_SRC
src/main.rs:69:25: 69:37 error: cannot move out of captured outer variable in an `Fn` closure
src/main.rs:69             do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
#+END_SRC

What does it mean to "move out of" a captured variable? I don't
remember anything that used language like moving in to or out of
variables, and besides, that sentence doesn't make any sense to me.

The error also says some other weird stuff; what does a
~Fn~ closure have to do with any of this?

I searched the Internet a while for this error message, and found some
results. However, none of them seemed like they applied to me. So,
back to playing around

* More Debugging

First, I tried compiling with the ~--verbose~ flag just to see if was
helpful, but it did not print any additional debugging information
about the error, only about the general command.

I remembered seeing a section specific to closures in the the Rust
book, so I decided to look at that. From it, my guess is that I need
to do a "move" closure. But, when I try it:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => move |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
        }
    });

#+END_SRC

... I get a new error message:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo run -- -l whodat
   Compiling simple-log v0.1.0 (file:///Users/joel/Projects/simple-log)
src/main.rs:66:21: 66:25 error: no rules expected the token `move`
src/main.rs:66         get "**" => move |_req, _res| {
                                   ^~~~
Could not compile `simple-log`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
#+END_SRC

This confused me, so I decided to just try to move it outside:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    foo = move |_req, _res| {
        do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
    };

    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => foo
    });

#+END_SRC

=>

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo run -- -l whodat
   Compiling simple-log v0.1.0 (file:///Users/joel/Projects/simple-log)
src/main.rs:70:21: 70:24 error: no rules expected the token `foo`
src/main.rs:70         get "**" => foo
                                   ^~~
Could not compile `simple-log`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
#+END_SRC

This is the same error message.

At this point, I notice that the language of the error message sounds
suspiciously like the wording used around Scheme pattern matching
macro systems, and I remember the ~router!~ macro being used
here. Some macro weirdness! I know how to solve this, because I had to
deal with it before.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ rustc src/main.rs --pretty=expanded -Z unstable-options
src/main.rs:5:14: 5:34 error: can't find crate for `nickel`
src/main.rs:5 #[macro_use] extern crate nickel;
#+END_SRC

So, I guess I need to pass this argument to cargo? Searching
cargo docs doesnt seem to show anything about passing ~rustc~ arguments.

Searching the Internet, I found some GitHub issues that indicate
sending arbitrary arguments
is not supported, besides creating a custom cargo command.
Creating a custom cargo command sounds like an awful diversion from
the problem I am trying to solve right now, so I don't want to go down
that route.

Suddenly, a wild idea appears: when using ~cargo run --verbose~, I saw this
~rustc~ command in its output:

#+BEGIN_SRC
# ...
Caused by:

... which makes me wonder: Could I modify this to make it compile and
output the macro-expanded code? Trying it:

It worked! It is inelegant, but at least I was able to
figure it out. It is also clearer to me how the ~cargo~ interfaces
with ~rustc~.

The relevant portion of the output is this:

    server.utilize({
                       use nickel::HttpRouter;
                       let mut router = ::nickel::Router::new();
                       {
                           router.get("**",
                                      {

                                                 Response<'a>) ->

                                              f
                                          }
                                          restrict_closure(move |_req, _res| {
                                                           restrict({
                                                                        do_log_time(logfile_path,
                                                                                    auth_token)
                                                                    }, _res)
                                                       })
                                      });
                           router
                       }
                   });
#+END_SRC

Ok, so that's a lot to look at. Let us unpack it a little bit.

There are two functions, ~restrict~ and ~restrict_closure~, that
immediately surprise me. I /think/ they exist to provide better
type/error messaging about these request handling closures.

However, what is even /more/ interesting is:

#+BEGIN_SRC
 restrict_closure(move |_req, _res| { ... })
#+END_SRC

... which tells me that macro is specify the closure as a move
closure /already/. Well, there goes that theory.

* Regrouping

Lets regroup and try to restate the problem.
At this point, I have a ~main~ that looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
fn main() {
    let matches = App::new("simple-log").version("v0.0.1")
        .arg(Arg::with_name("LOG FILE")
             .short("l")
             .long("logfile")
             .required(true)
             .takes_value(true))
        .arg(Arg::with_name("AUTH TOKEN")
             .short("t")
             .long("token")
             .takes_value(true))
        .get_matches();

    let logfile_path = matches.value_of("LOG FILE").unwrap().to_string();
    let auth_token = match matches.value_of("AUTH TOKEN") {
        Some(str) => Some(str.to_string()),
        None => None
    };

    let mut server = Nickel::new();
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
        }
    });

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:6767");
}
#+END_SRC

#+END_SRC



I asked about it on IRC, but I got no replies. Realistically, I should
have probably tried to ask on IRC during a time that I had more
patience, but it is what it is.

I submitted an issue on
the ~nickel.rs~ project, thinking that this was an issue with the
macro. This was the last idea I had -- I /knew/ how likely
it was that I was wrong, but I saw no other way forward and I didn't
want to give up.

And thus the issue at
[[https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs/issues/241]] was born. Ryman
quickly saw
my mistake and was kind enough to help me through it. Sure enough, he
was right -- if you're reading this Ryman, I owe you one.

The problem occurred in the following specific closure. Let us examine
it to see what we can see:

#+BEGIN_SRC
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path, auth_token)
        }
#+END_SRC

If you notice, here, the call to ~do_log_time~ is
/transferring ownership/
of ~logfile_path~ and ~auth_token~ to that invocation of that
function. This is where the problem is.

To my untrained eye, this looks "normal", the most natural form of the
code. There is an important caveat that I missed:
/in its current form, this lambda cannot be called more than once/.
On the first time it is called, ownership of ~logfile_path~ and
~auth_token~ are transferred to the invocation of
~do_log_time~. Here's the thing: if this function is called again, it
/couldn't/ transfer ownership to ~do_log_time~, as it no longer owns
these two variables.

Thus, we get the error message:

#+BEGIN_SRC
src/main.rs:69:39: 69:49 error: cannot move out of captured outer variable in an `Fn` closure
#+END_SRC

I still don't think it makes any sense but now I understand at least
that it deals with moving ownership "out" from a closure.

Anyway, the simplest way to fix this problem is to do:

#+BEGIN_SRC
    let mut server = Nickel::new();
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path.clone(), auth_token.clone())
        }
    });
#+END_SRC

Now, upon each invocation, ~logfile_path~ and ~auth_token~ are still
owned, but clones are created and ownership of the clones is transferred.

However, I'd like to point out that I still believe this is a
sub-optimal solution. Since passing ownership is not referentially
transparent by definition, I'm now leaning towards favoring the use of
references whenever possible.

Would rust have been better if it used bare symbols to represent
borrowed references, but some other symbol for owned, say ~*~? I don't
know, but is an interesting question.

* Refactoring

I'm going to try a quick refactor to see if I can make things use
references. This is going to be interesting, because I might have some
unforeseen problems arise -- we'll see!

I've been reading the Martin Fowler Refactoring book, and this has
renewed my appreciation for doing things in small steps at a
time. First, I want to change just one ownership transfer to a borrow;
lets start with ~logfile_path~. Starting with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
fn do_log_time(logfile_path: String, auth_token: Option<String>) -> String {
    match log_time(logfile_path) {
        Ok(entry) => format!("Entry Logged: {}", entry),
        Err(e) => format!("Error: {}", e)
    }
}

// ...

fn main() {
    // ...
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(logfile_path.clone(), auth_token.clone())
        }
    });
   // ...
}
#+END_SRC

I end up with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
fn do_log_time(logfile_path: &String, auth_token: Option<String>) -> String {
    match log_time(logfile_path.clone()) {
        Ok(entry) => format!("Entry Logged: {}", entry),
        Err(e) => format!("Error: {}", e)
    }
}

// ...

fn main() {
    // ...
    server.utilize(router! {
        get "**" => |_req, _res| {
            do_log_time(&logfile_path, auth_token.clone())
        }
    });
   // ...
}
#+END_SRC

This refactoring might be called something like:
/replace ownership with borrow and clone/. If I own something, and I
want to change this to a borrow, but I currently transfer ownership
somewhere else, I must create my own copy internally first. This
allows me to change my ownership to a borrow, and yet still transfer
ownership when I must. Of course, this involves cloning the
thing I borrowed, which duplicates memory and has performance costs,
but it allows me to change this line of code safely. I
can then keep replacing ownership with borrows without breaking
anything.


Applying this a few more times gives me this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::fs::OpenOptions;
use std::io;

#[macro_use] extern crate nickel;
use nickel::Nickel;

extern crate chrono;
use chrono::{DateTime,Local};

extern crate clap;
use clap::{App,Arg};

fn formatted_time_entry() -> String {
    let local: DateTime<Local> = Local::now();
    let formatted = local.format("%a, %b %d %Y %I:%M:%S %p\n").to_string();
    formatted
}

fn record_entry_in_log(filename: &String, bytes: &[u8]) -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = try!(OpenOptions::new().
                        append(true).

I'm going to need to deal with ~auth_token~ soon, but for now this is
a good place to stop.


* Conclusions & Retrospective on Part 4

The application now parses options. However, it was tremendously
difficult. I nearly ran out of options while trying solve my
problems. I would have been really frustrated if the issue on
nickel.rs wasn't resolved so helpfully.

Some lessons:

- Transferring ownership is a tricky thing. I think a new guideline
  for me is to favor passing immutable borrows by default unless I
  /must/ pass ownership for whatever reason.

- Cargo /really/ should have an option to pass arbitrary ~rustc~
  arguments.

- Some of the Rust error messages are still not very good.

- Even if the error messages were poor, Rust was still right --
  transferring ownership inside my closure /was/ an error, since the
  function is called many times, once per web request. A lesson here
  for me is: if
  I don't understand an error message, it would be a good idea to
  /think through/ the code, specifically looking what might be hard for
  Rust to prove to be safe.

This experience also reinforces my frustration with compiled,
strong-typed programming languages. Sometimes, you really need to
examine things /in vivo/ in order to appreciate what is going
on. In this example, it was hard to create a minimal reproducible that
illustrated the problem.

When error messages don't give you the information you need, you're
next best option is to start searching the Internet for information
related to the error message. This doesn't really give you the ability
to investigate, understand, and solve the problem yourself.

I think this could be alleviated by adding some ability to interrogate
the state of the compiler at different times, to find more information
about the problem. Something like opening an interactive prompt on
compile errors would be really great, but even annotating the code to
request detailed information from the compiler would be extremely useful.


---

I wrote this post over the course of about a month, mostly because I
was so busy dealing with house buying stuff. At times, I was
/extremely/ frustrated with some of this. I expected integrating
option parsing to be the easiest of tasks!

However, realizing that Rust caught my bug really relieving. Even if
the error message wasn't as good as I had hoped, I liked that this
would have been a legitimate segmentation fault that I was saved
from.

I hope that as Rust matures, the error messages get better. If they
do, I think all my concerns will disappear.
