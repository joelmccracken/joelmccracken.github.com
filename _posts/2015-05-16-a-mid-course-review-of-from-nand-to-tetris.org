title: A Mid-Course Review of "From NAND to Tetris" on Coursera

I've been taking the course "From NAND to Tetris" on Coursera. So far,
the course has been very interesting, and I recommend it. It provides
a good taste of how computers work from a low level, starting at the
most basic logic gates and building up from there. I'm over half way
through, and have some observations.

1. This course has been a blast! Slowly building up a computer from
   first principles has been very rewarding. Its an amazing
   feeling to struggle with designing a chip and then to turn around
   and use it in another, more advanced chip!

2. The course hasn't been that hard. Now, I had some classes that
   dealt with this kind of thing at Pitt. I remember working with
   most of these concepts in the past, so this is not totally foreign
   to me. However, I also think that the professors did an excellent
   job simplify things to their essential concepts.

I'm really glad I have invested my time into this course. If you want
to learn more about how computers work on a low level (or even if you
would like a refresher into the topic), I highly recommend it.
