# A Blog Post a Day #

Dear Internet, 

So, over the past months, I have gotten better about blogging. I still
am not where I would like to be, though. I want to change that. 

Internet presence is really important to me. I'm the kind of person
who thinks that we should judge each other on our ideas and
skills. The internet lets us show each other who we are and what we
can do. None of this is new (or, even, particularly interesting), but The
Point is that I am nowhere near satisfied with where I am right now.

Anyway, basically the entire blogging internet says that the
way to get great at blogging is to 
publish a blog post every day. So, here I am, publicly committing. 

A blog post a day. I think I can do it. And, I (hope) I will become a
better writer from it. 

Thanks for reading, 

Joel
