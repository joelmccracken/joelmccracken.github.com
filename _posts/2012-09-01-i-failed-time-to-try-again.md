# I Failed. Time to try again.#

Earlier this week, I stated my goal to blog every day... and two days later, I
failed. To be honest, it was much harder to take the time to write
after a full day of work. 

I write code for a living. After a day of writing code, there is
barely any writing prose. Last week I gave out before I got
anything to the point that I felt comfortable enough to publish. 

I still need to post, though, and to do so regularly. I haven't given
up on it. So, I need to try again. Since only fools try the same
thing again after failing without varying their methods, I'm going to
change up how I approach blogging.

1. Prewriting posts. Basically, this means that I am going
   to develop a few posts that will be (mostly) ready to go for
   whenever I don't feel up to creating something new... In
   fact, my plan is to actually do this right now, once I publish this
   post. I'll come back here and update when I get this done. 
    
2. Limiting the scope of posts. I really like exploratory writing. I
   love how writing helps you form ideas and discover new things. Its
   like magic pixie dust for ideas. This type of writing lends itself
   to a large body of text that just, well, meanders. Which would be
   fine, except it doesn't lend itself to meeting deadlines.
   
   So, I'm going to make an extra-strong effort to recognize when I
   start doing this, and then consciously put it off till later, first
   getting my daily post done.
   
3. 500 words. In the spirit of limiting the scope of a post, I'll keep
   a hard limit of 500 words on an post. This is something that I
   think is a good idea anyway. Concision is good.  And, I respect
   your time. 
   
4. Keep the long, deep posts elsewhere. Short, 500-word posts lack a
   certain depth. This means that there are lots of topics that really
   can't be discussed like this. I still want to write this kind of
   thing, but I wont treat them as blog posts.
   Longer-form writing will be treated like special articles. 
   
   I think this makes sense. Long-form essays are more like research
   projects than blog posts. Each style has its benefits, but
   confusing the two makes it hard to mange the writing process. 
   
Writing skill is really important for what I want to go with my
career. Regardless of the number of times I stumble, I must adjust,
dust myself off, and start writing again. That's just how life works.
