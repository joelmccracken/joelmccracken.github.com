title: 'Prototyping Applications in Emacs: Svbtle Model of Content Creation'
alias: /2012/09/06/prototyping-applications-in-emacs-svbtle.html
---

I'm always on the lookout for new ways to improve myself.
Emacs is one of the ways that I do this. 
Because all of Emacs' features are extremely accessible, it is easy to
quickly build what you need to get things done. 

I have written a few of these "mini-applications", but one is fresh in
my mind: svbtle. 
When svbtle was announced/released, I had mixed feelings
about it. However, one of the things that I *do* really like is the
application's split between published posts and ideas. 

In case you don't remember, everything in svbtle is either a published
post, or an idea. I think this split works, because pre-publishing,
writing is so... ephemeral. However, once something is out there, it
takes on a completely different character. 

I feel like *draft* has a negative connotation. An unpublished draft
is basically an undone to-do. Even the word draft implies work that
still needs to be done. 

However, labeling drafts as *ideas* changes them. Ideas are
positive. The more ideas you have, the better. And, an unpublished
idea is just, well, still an idea. I think this cognitive
shift encourages the writing process. 

So, I made a mental note, and began thinking about how I could implement this
in my writing process. Over the last few weeks, I spent 20 or so minutes here
and there hacking some code together that lets me think this way. So,
for a total of *at most* two hours, I got most of the 
benefit that I perceive from svbtle. And, that makes me very happy.

Now, time for the code. It isn't pretty or well-factored, but it
does what I need. I want to show it like this because it
works, and is good enough. There's nothing magic here; its straight-up
maneuvering of files, Emacs buffers, and window layouts. It also sits
on top of Jekyll, because that I what I started with.
