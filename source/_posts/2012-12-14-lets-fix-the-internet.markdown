Recently, Anil Dash posted an article entitled
[The Web We Lost](http://dashes.com/nail/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.HTML).
In it, Anil discusses the walled-data-silo that is the modern web, and
how less friendly and useful modern web services are.

This really speaks to my heart. Personally, I hate having to use the
various web services that I do. I try to keep these websites to a
minimum, but the ones I do use are simply too valuable to me to go
without them. I could avoid using twitter, but the network effects are
really high, and I just haven't had the time to work out the rough
edges to using
[my rstat.us account](https://rstat.us/users/JoelMcCracken). 


A Solution: People-Friendly Servers
-----------------------------------

I have been paying $15/month for years now for a Dreamhost VPS that I
do almost nothing with, in the hopes that someday I will have the time
to set up an email server the way I want, some kind of
microblog, and regular blog. I don't think this should be all that
hard, though.

Imagine a system where a user visits our person-friendly server
site. They sign up and provide payment information, and then our
systems get to work.

A VPS is requisitioned on Amazon's cloud. A standard system image is
installed on the machine, and the user is emailed with a link to log into
their new server. Once they log in, the user can choose to install
different "Apps", such as email, blogging, and file backup and
syncing.


Moving Forward
--------------

Obviously, such a system would face huge technical
challenges. I don't think such challenges would stop something like
this, but they might require some rethinking of the way network
servers are built. 

I have been spending time exploring this idea. I'm really awful about
polishing and publishing scripts that I write, but this is something
that is important enough to make sure it gets done.

I am trying to figure out an organizational structure to support such
a system. A Co-op or a B-Corp seems like the most realistic and
ideologically sounds system for something like this.

Do you have any thoughts? Do you want to help build something like
this? Let me know.
