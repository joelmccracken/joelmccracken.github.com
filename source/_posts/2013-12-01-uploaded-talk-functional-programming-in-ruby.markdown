I just uploaded the slides from my Functional Programming in Ruby
talk, given at the
[Pgh.rb in November](http://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-ruby/events/143979972/).

The
[source](https://github.com/joelmccracken/functional-programming-in-ruby)
is available on Github, and you can view the
slides
[here](http://joelmccracken.github.io/functional-programming-in-ruby/),
or view them them below.

On a semi-unrelated note, since
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)
presentations are just HTML, pushing the raw repository to a `gh-pages`
branch makes it publicly viewable. Which is awesome.
