title: A Simple Web App in Rust, Part 4 -- CLI Option Parsing
---
I'm
going to briefly attempt to do some command parsing. First, I'm going
to move this file out of the way to do some CLI parsing
experimentation. But, before that, lets just clean things up a bit:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ ls
Cargo.lock      Cargo.toml      log.txt         src             target
$ cd src/
$ ls
main.rs                 main_file_writing.rs    web_main.rs
#+END_SRC

~main_file_writing.rs~ and ~web_main.rs~ are both old, so I can remove
them. After that I'll move ~main.rs~ to, say, ~main_logging_server.rs~
and create a new ~main.rs~.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ git rm main_file_writing.rs web_main.rs
rm 'src/main_file_writing.rs'
rm 'src/web_main.rs'
$ git commit -m 'remove old files'
[master 771380b] remove old files
 2 files changed, 35 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 src/main_file_writing.rs
 delete mode 100644 src/web_main.rs
$ git mv main.rs main_logging_server.rs
$ git commit -m 'move main out of the way for cli parsing experiment'
[master 4d24206] move main out of the way for cli parsing experiment
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename src/{main.rs => main_logging_server.rs} (100%)
$ touch main.rs
#+END_SRC


On to parameter parsing. In an earlier post,
[[http://blog.ssokolow.com/][Stephan Sokolow]] asked if I had considered using the package [[https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs][clap]] for
command line parsing. I was going to use
