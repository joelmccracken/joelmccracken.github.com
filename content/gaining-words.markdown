The words we know and use are really important, and sometimes I forget
how important. To illustrate, try this experiment with me, please. 

First, think of an apple, but try to not use words -- think of the
apple, but not in terms of the word. You might be able to consider an
apple some other way besides mental words. For example,  you might be
able to "see" an apple, mentally. 

Now, think about the idea of "rebellion", again without using any mental
words. Notice anything different? 

For me, thinking of an apple wasn't all
that hard. I can see it in my mind, and I feel reasonably comfortable
that this is good enough to describe an apple. 

However, thinking about rebellion without using words in my mind is
really, really hard. For example, I imagined a scene from the American
civil war. It was pretty easy, but I wasn't able to come up with any
sense of how the civil war is different than, say, World War I. I also
couldn't come up with any way of thinking about the similarity between
the civil war and a child disobeying their parents, for example.  

Because of this strangeness, [lots of people][] think that speech and
thought are tightly intertwined -- really, almost the same thing. 

Just think about that! Our entire existance is made up of our
thoughts, besides basic feelings and emotions. Really, its hard to
think of anything more fundamentally important than that. 

## Losing Words

If we don't know a word, we haven't had the idea exposed to us
yet. If we haven't thought about the idea, we either won't ever recall
it or will need to come up with the idea by ourselves. 

This really limits us -- not having words. Could you imagine being the
first one to come up with the idea of freedom? So many other ideas
follow from it, ones which cannot exist without it. Our thoughts would
be much limited than otherwise.

## Gaining Words

However, there is a flip to this. If we learn new words, we have
access to new ideas. We can have much more rich thought. We are
smarter, able to notice opportunity better than before. Having more
raw materiel ("words") fom which to create thought is a really super
useful thing. 

## Inventing words

What happens, though, when you come up with a truly original thought?
What If you think this thought is really important, and that maybe you
want to be able to share it with other people? 

Create a new word! Once you've made your word, you are free to combine
it with others to create even more ideas. This new abstraction (new
"word") gives you the ability discover all sorts of new
thoughts. Others may be enriched by your awesome idea-word, and the
world might become a better place if your new word goes viral!



**
The Takeaway: Care about words. They're the stuff your existance is
made out of. Learn new ones. And, possibly, if someday you come up
with a really great thought, make a new word to share your thought
with others.
