title: Heirloom Design
---
Recently, I ran into an idea I really liked: heirloom design. Coined
by the inventor [Saul Griffith][saulgriffith]
[<sup>1</sup>][stt],
I'll allow him to explain it: 
  
>"An object with 'heirloom design' is something that will not only last through your 
>lifetime and into the next generation, but that you also desire to keep that long because 
>it's beautiful, functional, and timeless."
Saul Griffith, from [Built to Last][btl]

I'd like to take this one step further, and [coin a few new terms][coinaterm], based on this idea.

heirloom (n)

1. an object that has been designed to last into the next generation, as well as 
is desired to last because of being beautiful, functional, and timeless.
     
heirloom (adj)   

1. designed to last into the next generation; also, 
beautiful, functional, and timeless.
  
heirloom design (n)

1. the process of creating something that will last 
to many generations.
  
disclaimer: This is neither my idea, nor do I want you to think it is. If I 
have not made it clear in the above discussion, this wondeful idea comes
from Saul Griffith. I want to give it a better, more
"referenceable" home than buried in an 
interview. This page is also intentionally sparse because I want to add very 
little to it.
  

1. You may remember Saul's [TED talk][talk]. [#][stt]{: #sauls-ted-talk}
