Human abstract thought seems to depend upon language. When we have a word for something, we 
seem to be able to discuss it, combine it, and destruct it. When we don't have a word for 
an idea, we have a hard (or impossible?) time thinking about it.

To illustrate, consider two ideas. Think of an apple, but try to not use words ("see" and 
apple with your mind's eye). I don't know about you, but I don't find this exercise to be 
all that hard.

Now, think about "rebellion", again without using mental "words". Hard, isn't it? If 
you're like me, you might imagine a battle scene. But, how do you comprehend the necessary 
distinction between the American Civil War and World War II? Or, how do you comprehend 
the similarities between the American Civil War and a child rebelling against his parent? 
This is the idea that Orwell was trying to express, above.


## Language Quality

The quality of thought is important. 
Even though we don't normally think of it like this, society is always
telling us that we want to "think better". "Smart" is
better than "stupid". "Creative" is better than "uninspired". "Witty"
is better than "humorless". If we can somehow improve ourselves,
becoming smarter, wittier, and more creative, shouldn't we?

We can also say language that is more
clear and more concise is better than otherwise. Higher quality
thought is important to us individually, as thoughts are largely what
our lives are made out of.

Thus, if we want to think better, a good approach can be to speak
better. A better grasp of language gives us a larger set of raw 
material with which to create new thoughts.

It is clearly possible to change language, for better or for
worse. Orwell's 1984 convinces us of that. Lets consider two ways
language can change: destroying words, and creating words.


## Destroying Words

Words cannot be destroyed outright -- you cannot erase them from
everyone's books and minds. However, if you don't know them or
use them, they do not exist for you -- they may as well have never
existed.

This isn't always a bad thing. Humans only have so much mental
capacity, and some words are better off as the jargon of
historians.

However, if knowing a word enables us to be smarter, wittier, and more
creative, then we are worse off having lost it<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.

## Creating Words

Sometimes, we create new names for things, such as inventions. While
this is important, it is also somewhat obvious, and thus not very
interesting. 

Other times, an idea will strike, and this idea is interesting enough
to create a new word that describes it. "Freedom" is one of those words,
but "truthiness" and "trending" are more recent examples of newly
created words that are simply based on ideas.

If you have an idea, and you think it is an important idea, give it a
name. If others agree with you about its importance, it might 
catch on and greatly influence the thoughts of others. And, once you 
have use of this new word, you can use it to create possibly 
more important, greater ideas.

that has become commonplace. In many people, swearing has replaced actual, 
useful thought, although apparently it can [make people feel
better][feelbetter].
